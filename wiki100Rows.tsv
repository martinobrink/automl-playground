0	 :Michael, with all due respect, it's over. It may be that you can do math better than me, but it's not the math that's the problem, it's statements like "I don't know a whole lot about this case, but I tend to think that race may well be relevant here" and "My first instinct is it likely should be included as the news accounts likely included the information. But did they or was this simply not an issue?". I assume you are "counting" those as "in favour of inclusion"really, one can't. They are not unequivocal inclusion votes and raise more questions than they answer. Moreover, I assume you're including comments like "I agree that race should be included as long as it does not violate WP:UNDUE." That's finebut this participant did not address how the inclusion does not violate UNDUE, and since this (as John points out) is not a vote, such a statement can't have the full weight as is carried by the more complete answers of John and Beyond My Ken.

0	   Hi. I am new to this and am not a registered user yet so do not know another way to send you a comment.  This is re: the entries on David Brock & The American Spectator.  I am 100% positive the quote from the Brock article on Anita Hill in the magazine is "a bit nutty, and a bit slutty" (actual quote is: "So Hill may be a bit nutty, and a bit slutty, but is she an outright liar?") because I checked it in the original magazine article.  I believe the quote is the same in the Real Anita Hill book, but I do not have the book on hand to check so I will not argue that at at this time.  It is true that the quote has been widely reportered as having "little" in it, but that error spread uncontrollably in the age of Nexis after Andrew Sullivan and others quoted it incorrectly.  Thank you for your edits!
0	  I note that people on here just got Wikid77 blocked for three months because he allegedly communicated behind closed doors, called "canvassing." Why isn't re-writing a whole article just with a group of people who all agree with each other, with no clear notice to the public what is going on or where this draft is located, or how they can participate, even worse? This sure looks worse to me, like some sort of Tag Team situation, even if it isn't exactly canvassing. I don't see why it is okay for a group to plan to remove a whole article behind closed doors, while what he did is so egregious you wanted him blocked for three months. In my opinion, this attempted re-write behind closed doors violates Wikipedia policy on openness. That is all I am going to say for now at this level. Have a nice day.

0	  :::::Once again, I disagree on all counts. It should be PATENTLY obviously to anyone reading about vaginoplasty and metoidioplasty surgery whose purpose is the creation of a vagina or a penis, that it is about the vagina and genitalia in a surgical context and that therefore photos of the surgery will of necessity include photos of the vagina or the penis as is relevant to the surgical procedure. The graphic is entirely editorial, and unfairly demonstrates a bias on the part of an author that is unfair and un called for in this context. I believe such notices set a socially incorrect precedent that should be reversed. Such notices are inappropriate in a medical context. An encyclopedia for the world should not "cau tau" to the overly prudish, biased, morees of certain absurdly puritanical cultures. Regarding the citation issues, I will repeat that this article is being held to an unfair and entirely biased standard that is not at all representative of the wikipedia and does not serve either its contributors or the likely potential readers of this article about this surgeon. Most people looking for this article will already be at least marginally aware that the surgical techniques Toby Meltzer has pioneered have given him renown among his peers, patients, and potential patients. A google search on "Toby Meltzer" will reveal the countless ocassions on which Toby Meltzer, MD is asked to give public presentations on his work.  20:16, 17 September 2006.

0	  Actually, only one sign in the movie says that, and it was written by an activist shown briefly, so the actual spelling is "prawn".      "Command Module"   In the plot summary, it says that Christopher had the command module under his house and flew to the mothership in it. However, in the movie it is implied that it's not a command module but some sort of ship, and the only reason Christopher needed it was to get to the mothership. If nobody disagrees, I will change it to say that.

0	:Are you saying Quinn is fringe or Quinn's argument on gays is fringe? I'm not sure Quinn himself is fringe. Ed Decker on the other hand... I'd say if consensus around the definition of a fringe critic could be built and fringe critics could be identified, a better place for their criticisms would be the Anti-Mormonism article. That would be consistent with WP:FRINGE because it would place the criticisms in context. That being said, I do agree with your identification of Quinn as an openly gay critic, given the nature of his criticism.

0	The reason that Morocco is not a member of the AU is because the organization admitted the SADR as a full member.  The AU covers the entire continent except for Morocco, which opposes the membership of Western Sahara as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. However, Morocco has a special status within the AU and benefits from the services available to all AU states from the institutions of the AU...(from article AU)  But the former king, Hassan II, did say Morocco was a tree with it's roots in Africa and it's branches in Europe.

0	   High Tech Postcode Recommended    An Irish Cross Party Parliamentary (Oireachtas) Committee has recommended the implementation of a unique Identifier Postcode  for Ireland according to "The Post Codes Report" as reflected in the Irish Examiner. The code now recommended will be such that it can be supported on google maps, iphones and GPS and will be capable of a unique postcode for each property.  The report questions any plan to introduce a broad area code which is unable to identify properties and states that the proposal for a D04 123 type code may make address ambiguity and problems with finding properties in Ireland even worse.  The report is from the Joint Communications Committee of the Irish Parliament and includes members of most political parties. It was published on 31 March 2010 and will lead to a significant revision of existing proposals  Late on 1st April, the full report was released and is available for download here There is considerable mention of the use of GPS in relation to the new code in the report and both the HSE and the GeoComputation Centre in NUI Maynooth are quoted as being strongly in favour of a code which provides a unique identifier such as is achieved with a GPS related code..   On 14th April, the report was followed by the cancellation for the tender for a consultant to advise the Minister for Communications on the implementation of a Postcode in Ireland.

0	::Me. I would be most grateful for including material on the medieval superbridge at Trezzo sull'Adda. Why? Because this bridge must have been amazing as it doubled the longest span of stone bridges then (from 37 to 72). Still, the briidge is almost unknown, as nobody covers the subject.   ::There is also a claim that the Etruscans build very early on stone arch bridges (earlier than both Greeks and Romans). Two of them are included in Structurae, but I am not sure whether these are still the original structures. Including the Etruscans in a comprehensive history of stone arch bridges would definitely be an almost revolutionary thing.  ::For the timeline, see also * Trajan's Bridge - longest span for a 1000 years * Ponte Santa Trinità - first elliptical arch bridge * Steinerne Brücke in Regensburg, Germany - model for many medieval bridges to come * Pont Saint-Bénezet - IMHO this bridge could be the first segmental arch bridge in Europe. What we need is the span-rise-ratio. Regards

0	  ::I would like to point out that there used to be a great deal of, in my opinion, very unnecessary fighting over terms such as "circumcised" vs "unmutilatedcastratedstabbedpenismurdered".  ::Isn't it advisable, to at least be able to use a more scientific sounding vocabulary - as in, detached from everyday speech and associations to avoid emotions. Synonyms like that are an important part of an article when stuff is looked up primarily by text search - if relevant words are missing, the article fails as a whole. Dictionaries are never complete, and neither is Wikipedia. The advantage of Wikipedia being, that we can update her ourselves as new information becomes more widely available. IAR2TR.

0	The other ironies of mentioning the 1958 Convention include the fact that Argentina never actually ratified that convention and that even if they had, geographic proximity was not, in and of itself, considered by that convention to be grounds to claim sovereignty over an inhabited territory controlled by another state.  Otherwise Japan would be part of Russia and Malta would be part of Italy and Sri Lanka would be part of India and so on through literally dozens of examples.  It's such a bad argument legally that I was concerned when it went in that including it might appear to discredit the Argentine position.  But if it is an argument made by Argentina and her supporters then it belongs.  :As a general rule, you can accept or refuse a proposal, but you may also make a counterproposal to improve the article.  It's not a flat yes or no, otherwise things would never improve.  For my part, I gave my position on the map above:  :*I oppose any attempt to map the countries that support one side or other, as this is very difficult to get a clear position on.  But this is not such a map. :*I am indifferent to this map of the EU and its ORs and OCTs.  I have no problem with its going in, and I have no problem with its being left out. '''' ''''

0	The article HOORSENBUHS has been speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group or service and which would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read the general criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 11, as well as the guidelines on spam. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.
0	Comparison of Systems  Does anyone have a top-level comparison of the various systems.  A table may serve, followed by more detailed explanation of the differences ... followed perhaps on a historical perspective on the behind-the-scenes machinations.  There was an idea once upon a time that there would be a universal (global) HDTV standard ... does anyone have a good handle of how this patchwork quilt emerged from the good intent to agree on a global HDTV system?

0	:Hi Paranoid. I aggree that the Moscow page needs work. We also need to work on articles within moscow - for example, the MSU page is shocking bad. But I'd argue that most people who add to the moscow page have an honest interest and fondness for the place, or they wouldn't bother editing it. Maybe what we need is a 'List of Moscow related articles needing work' or some such.  :The Recreation section is bad and It been an eyesore since feb. What should we add to it? There's a F1 circuit being built in the south, anybody want to add that? also some stuff on the football clubs would be good (we can leave out the supporter violence, which is a usual thing all over the world). To be honest, I don't know much about this area - not a football fan. :I'd also argue against only adding material which is positive. We shouldn't have an audience only of americans in mind.

0	    Hello, thanks.  I'ved changed all refs to be of Citation style.  I believe this article is ready to be added to the wiki.  Please, is it too much to ask that it be looked over before hand to chekc that it complies with wiki regulations.    There are two issues still of concern.  1.  References from 34 to the end are not listed in list of references even though they are in the text.  2.  Avraham has apparently barred me for "abusive" usage of my id.  I have queried him on this have no answer and the barring still occasionally appears when I log in.  In sum, can you halp me with these last two matters and most importantly tell me if this is ready to go on wiki.  Thanks very much

0	June 2010 (UTC) Since my last bot-related question to you got archived and this is somewhat CCI related, I'm shoehorning it in here: The way VWBot is currently running it thinks that articles from a CCI which were blanked on the day a CCI gets closed need to have their contributor notified (see  for two examples from yesterday). I know that it isn't required to notify contributors about a CCI blanking, but is it a problem if the bot does it for whichever articles are blanked on the day their CCI is closed? I haven't been able to think of an easy way to account for closed CCIs yet, so I guess I just want your take on if it's a big enough problem to worry about for later.   03:38, 29
0	Instead of making the same mistake that many make stop and think a bit. The Church councils were not about making up anything. what happened was that the church always believed the Bible and never questioned it. When some misguided fool would start to preach a false doctrine that went against the Bible then the church simply said hay look the Bible says this and if you reject what the Bible says then you cannot be a Christian. There were no conspiracies or dark room meeting. Why didn't the church have a set Cannon until about the 320 ADs - because there were no fake writings until the Gnostic gospels were written and some were fooled by them so the church was forced to make a list of the real Bible verse the Gnostic ones. Why did the Church have to speak about the deity of Jesus - because the gnostic Cults began to make up false writings and so the church simple said - JOHN SAID JESUS WAS GOD BELIEVE IT OR GET OUT. The same thing is happening today. Why is there so much talk about Homosexuality in the church today - Simple, there was no need to speak of it until the Homosexual community started to twist the Bible and now the church is forced to say HAY THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. It happened in the 1860 regarding Slavery and I'm sure it will happen in the furture when some other group comes along and tries to add to the Bible.

0	Hi Why is this page being deleted
0	  We're also moving from simple and concise to circuitous and verbose:  "Distortion effects generally mean both soft and hard clipping, and distortion is caused by perfectly flattened peaks due to saturation or cutoff inside a transistor based unit that does not attempt to smooth the clipping of peaks, will be called a distortion pedal, as the transistor responds to changes in voltage quicker than a tube can, while overdrive pedals, usually consisting of transistor based "Overdrive" pedals exist, in which an attempt at emulating "Tube-like Distortion" is made through extensive electronics and IC design, will retain their typical sine wave form, but will be compressed such that there is less difference between the RMS and the peak of a wave. Overdrive units created with transistors, much like tube amps, produce "clean" sounds at quieter volumes and distorted "warm" sounds at louder volumes, compared to the "harsh" or "gritty" sound of simple transistor distortion."  It's going to take me a while to make sense of this.
