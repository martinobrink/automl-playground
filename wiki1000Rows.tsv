0	 :Michael, with all due respect, it's over. It may be that you can do math better than me, but it's not the math that's the problem, it's statements like "I don't know a whole lot about this case, but I tend to think that race may well be relevant here" and "My first instinct is it likely should be included as the news accounts likely included the information. But did they or was this simply not an issue?". I assume you are "counting" those as "in favour of inclusion"really, one can't. They are not unequivocal inclusion votes and raise more questions than they answer. Moreover, I assume you're including comments like "I agree that race should be included as long as it does not violate WP:UNDUE." That's finebut this participant did not address how the inclusion does not violate UNDUE, and since this (as John points out) is not a vote, such a statement can't have the full weight as is carried by the more complete answers of John and Beyond My Ken.

0	   Hi. I am new to this and am not a registered user yet so do not know another way to send you a comment.  This is re: the entries on David Brock & The American Spectator.  I am 100% positive the quote from the Brock article on Anita Hill in the magazine is "a bit nutty, and a bit slutty" (actual quote is: "So Hill may be a bit nutty, and a bit slutty, but is she an outright liar?") because I checked it in the original magazine article.  I believe the quote is the same in the Real Anita Hill book, but I do not have the book on hand to check so I will not argue that at at this time.  It is true that the quote has been widely reportered as having "little" in it, but that error spread uncontrollably in the age of Nexis after Andrew Sullivan and others quoted it incorrectly.  Thank you for your edits!
0	  I note that people on here just got Wikid77 blocked for three months because he allegedly communicated behind closed doors, called "canvassing." Why isn't re-writing a whole article just with a group of people who all agree with each other, with no clear notice to the public what is going on or where this draft is located, or how they can participate, even worse? This sure looks worse to me, like some sort of Tag Team situation, even if it isn't exactly canvassing. I don't see why it is okay for a group to plan to remove a whole article behind closed doors, while what he did is so egregious you wanted him blocked for three months. In my opinion, this attempted re-write behind closed doors violates Wikipedia policy on openness. That is all I am going to say for now at this level. Have a nice day.

0	  :::::Once again, I disagree on all counts. It should be PATENTLY obviously to anyone reading about vaginoplasty and metoidioplasty surgery whose purpose is the creation of a vagina or a penis, that it is about the vagina and genitalia in a surgical context and that therefore photos of the surgery will of necessity include photos of the vagina or the penis as is relevant to the surgical procedure. The graphic is entirely editorial, and unfairly demonstrates a bias on the part of an author that is unfair and un called for in this context. I believe such notices set a socially incorrect precedent that should be reversed. Such notices are inappropriate in a medical context. An encyclopedia for the world should not "cau tau" to the overly prudish, biased, morees of certain absurdly puritanical cultures. Regarding the citation issues, I will repeat that this article is being held to an unfair and entirely biased standard that is not at all representative of the wikipedia and does not serve either its contributors or the likely potential readers of this article about this surgeon. Most people looking for this article will already be at least marginally aware that the surgical techniques Toby Meltzer has pioneered have given him renown among his peers, patients, and potential patients. A google search on "Toby Meltzer" will reveal the countless ocassions on which Toby Meltzer, MD is asked to give public presentations on his work.  20:16, 17 September 2006.

0	  Actually, only one sign in the movie says that, and it was written by an activist shown briefly, so the actual spelling is "prawn".      "Command Module"   In the plot summary, it says that Christopher had the command module under his house and flew to the mothership in it. However, in the movie it is implied that it's not a command module but some sort of ship, and the only reason Christopher needed it was to get to the mothership. If nobody disagrees, I will change it to say that.

0	:Are you saying Quinn is fringe or Quinn's argument on gays is fringe? I'm not sure Quinn himself is fringe. Ed Decker on the other hand... I'd say if consensus around the definition of a fringe critic could be built and fringe critics could be identified, a better place for their criticisms would be the Anti-Mormonism article. That would be consistent with WP:FRINGE because it would place the criticisms in context. That being said, I do agree with your identification of Quinn as an openly gay critic, given the nature of his criticism.

0	The reason that Morocco is not a member of the AU is because the organization admitted the SADR as a full member.  The AU covers the entire continent except for Morocco, which opposes the membership of Western Sahara as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. However, Morocco has a special status within the AU and benefits from the services available to all AU states from the institutions of the AU...(from article AU)  But the former king, Hassan II, did say Morocco was a tree with it's roots in Africa and it's branches in Europe.

0	   High Tech Postcode Recommended    An Irish Cross Party Parliamentary (Oireachtas) Committee has recommended the implementation of a unique Identifier Postcode  for Ireland according to "The Post Codes Report" as reflected in the Irish Examiner. The code now recommended will be such that it can be supported on google maps, iphones and GPS and will be capable of a unique postcode for each property.  The report questions any plan to introduce a broad area code which is unable to identify properties and states that the proposal for a D04 123 type code may make address ambiguity and problems with finding properties in Ireland even worse.  The report is from the Joint Communications Committee of the Irish Parliament and includes members of most political parties. It was published on 31 March 2010 and will lead to a significant revision of existing proposals  Late on 1st April, the full report was released and is available for download here There is considerable mention of the use of GPS in relation to the new code in the report and both the HSE and the GeoComputation Centre in NUI Maynooth are quoted as being strongly in favour of a code which provides a unique identifier such as is achieved with a GPS related code..   On 14th April, the report was followed by the cancellation for the tender for a consultant to advise the Minister for Communications on the implementation of a Postcode in Ireland.

0	::Me. I would be most grateful for including material on the medieval superbridge at Trezzo sull'Adda. Why? Because this bridge must have been amazing as it doubled the longest span of stone bridges then (from 37 to 72). Still, the briidge is almost unknown, as nobody covers the subject.   ::There is also a claim that the Etruscans build very early on stone arch bridges (earlier than both Greeks and Romans). Two of them are included in Structurae, but I am not sure whether these are still the original structures. Including the Etruscans in a comprehensive history of stone arch bridges would definitely be an almost revolutionary thing.  ::For the timeline, see also * Trajan's Bridge - longest span for a 1000 years * Ponte Santa Trinità - first elliptical arch bridge * Steinerne Brücke in Regensburg, Germany - model for many medieval bridges to come * Pont Saint-Bénezet - IMHO this bridge could be the first segmental arch bridge in Europe. What we need is the span-rise-ratio. Regards

0	The other ironies of mentioning the 1958 Convention include the fact that Argentina never actually ratified that convention and that even if they had, geographic proximity was not, in and of itself, considered by that convention to be grounds to claim sovereignty over an inhabited territory controlled by another state.  Otherwise Japan would be part of Russia and Malta would be part of Italy and Sri Lanka would be part of India and so on through literally dozens of examples.  It's such a bad argument legally that I was concerned when it went in that including it might appear to discredit the Argentine position.  But if it is an argument made by Argentina and her supporters then it belongs.  :As a general rule, you can accept or refuse a proposal, but you may also make a counterproposal to improve the article.

0	June 2010 (UTC) Since my last bot-related question to you got archived and this is somewhat CCI related, I'm shoehorning it in here: The way VWBot is currently running it thinks that articles from a CCI which were blanked on the day a CCI gets closed need to have their contributor notified (see  for two examples from yesterday). I know that it isn't required to notify contributors about a CCI blanking, but is it a problem if the bot does it for whichever articles are blanked on the day their CCI is closed? I haven't been able to think of an easy way to account for closed CCIs yet, so I guess I just want your take on if it's a big enough problem to worry about for later.   03:38, 29
0	Instead of making the same mistake that many make stop and think a bit. The Church councils were not about making up anything. what happened was that the church always believed the Bible and never questioned it. When some misguided fool would start to preach a false doctrine that went against the Bible then the church simply said hay look the Bible says this and if you reject what the Bible says then you cannot be a Christian. There were no conspiracies or dark room meeting. Why didn't the church have a set Cannon until about the 320 ADs - because there were no fake writings until the Gnostic gospels were written and some were fooled by them so the church was forced to make a list of the real Bible verse the Gnostic ones. Why did the Church have to speak about the deity of Jesus - because the gnostic Cults began to make up false writings and so the church simple said - JOHN SAID JESUS WAS GOD BELIEVE IT OR GET OUT. The same thing is happening today. Why is there so much talk about Homosexuality in the church today - Simple, there was no need to speak of it until the Homosexual community started to twist the Bible and now the church is forced to say HAY THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS. It happened in the 1860 regarding Slavery and I'm sure it will happen in the furture when some other group comes along and tries to add to the Bible.

0	  We're also moving from simple and concise to circuitous and verbose:  "Distortion effects generally mean both soft and hard clipping, and distortion is caused by perfectly flattened peaks due to saturation or cutoff inside a transistor based unit that does not attempt to smooth the clipping of peaks, will be called a distortion pedal, as the transistor responds to changes in voltage quicker than a tube can, while overdrive pedals, usually consisting of transistor based "Overdrive" pedals exist, in which an attempt at emulating "Tube-like Distortion" is made through extensive electronics and IC design, will retain their typical sine wave form, but will be compressed such that there is less difference between the RMS and the peak of a wave. Overdrive units created with transistors, much like tube amps, produce "clean" sounds at quieter volumes and distorted "warm" sounds at louder volumes, compared to the "harsh" or "gritty" sound of simple transistor distortion."  It's going to take me a while to make sense of this.

0	 Well as for Bynes her father's surname doesn't really match either, does it? I find surnames in 2006 can be grossly misleading and don't necessarily mean much. In 1900, sure, but at this point everyone's changed their names and intermarried enough that you can't tell who is what by last name. Why wouldn't Eli's father be Jewish? He's Joseph Cross, also the father of actress Flora Cross, who is Jewish but whose mother is apparently not Eli's mother. There are seemingly a bunch of Jewish "Cross"'s out there, anyway. Well in the case of footnotes the point is really - the list is called a list of Jewish people - so the most important part is really whether the person themselves is "Jewish". The mistake I guess many made before is thinking that the most important part was whether one of their parents or something are Jewish. I think adding a quote about Elvis' ancestry however is important since in his case it is a big stretch and it's for the most part, something that biographers added on after his death, so it would definitely be helpful. But in cases like Bynes, Lauren Storm, plenty of others it's really mostly irrelevant if they are not "ethnically" fully Jewish (and besides, that can be found out in their entry), same for the other X-American lists, establishing that someone is Italian-American is good enough, for example, on List of Italian American actors, I'm sure Tina Majorino's mother isn't Italian (with Italians, unlike Jews, you can obviously tell that if someone's mother's maiden name is "Black" they are most likely not Italian) but the source just calls her Italian, so that's good enough for us. Family tree stuff isn't the most important. Plus - of course - most of the quotes in the numbers for people who are half already say they are half - but I'll go over them below here. As for practicing Judaism - well of the people who are half and whose one non-Jewish parent didn't convert in the 1980s - LaBeouf was raised Jewish/practices and the source quoted says he is Cajun also, Scarlett wore a Star of David to a bunch of events, Jake Gyllenhaal was raised Jewish, and the quote says he is only Jewish on his mother's side anyway, Grey raised Jewish, Flynn's mother apparently converted, Feldman raised Jewish and the quote says his mother wasn't, Carter quote says his father is Jewish only, Bynes says she is "Jewish" and we don't even know which parent (actually for the longest time Wikipedia, under someone's assumption, had "Jewish mother". But this was removed once I came in and started purging these assumption games other editors played and started putting in only verified facts )), Bilson quote says she is half Italian half Jewish, ditto for Baldoni, Paxton quote says all we know, that she is Jewish (maybe her non-Jewish parent converted), Peck grew up with a Jewish single mother, he doesn't know who his biological father was and he was likely Jewish anyway, Prepon we don't know which parent, Reed's brother had a Bar Mitzvah and sources/herself have called her "Jewish", Schwartzman - dunno, Sigler mother converted, Thomas raised Jewish, and the source says his father isn't anyway, Vuolo father converted, Wilson raised Jewish, I think that's about it. So, as you can see, for a large number of these, the quote already says that they aren't "ethnically" all Jewish if that was relevant. OK, as for JInfo, yes, it seems to definitely fall under "some guy's website". It does sometime cite sources, right? But often it doesn't. So I would say, yes, generally do not use it.  
0	   Actually, the article you're referring toThe Quest for the Historical Jesus is about "The quest for the historical Jesus is the academic effort to use historical methods to provide a historical portrait of Jesus.[1] " And this article is about those historical portriats of Jesus. That's why it should be renamed Historical portraits of jesus.   and   you both seem to be confused about the difference between historicity and historical portraits. John, you seem to think that biblical scripture is accepted as being historically accurate and Akhilleus you seem to think that the historical methods used to provide a historical portrait of Jesus are different than the historical methods used by muslim scholars to provide a historical portrait of jesus. Both of your positions are christian POV. Neutral POV here would be a secular one, and from that perspective, Islamic portraits by muslim scholars can be included. That is, unless the name of the article is changed to Christian historical portraits of Jesus. Perhaps this article should be merged with "The Quest for the historical Jesus" article.

I would have restored the last incarnation of the deleted article (not earlier versions, which contained copyright infrignements) and moved it to your userspace. However, the article has now been re-created, and since there doesn't seem to be anything significant in the deleted version that is not also in the new article, so there doesn't seem to be much point in restoring it now. I have corrected a couple of grammatical mistakes in the new article. Apart from that, the most important thing needing to be done to the article, in my opinion, is checking the reference citations, and moving them to appropriate parts of the article, rather than all in a list at the end.

This is a book on a subject of particular interest to (perhaps unjustly) a rather small number of people, and published by a (perhaps unjustly) obscure publisher.

If the guy gives lectures in New York synagogues and knocks down his country every single minute, using every opportunity in such influential newspapers as New York Post, then one can state that his interests are not only personal. You can not find any intellectual person among neoconservatives in New York Post. Michelle Malkin, Andrea Peyser, Deborah Orin (may her rest in peace, although I know she is rotting in hell)and other essayists are the ones who make a great company for Amir Taheri. This guy has no mind at all. I agree that Iran's regime is wrong, but the regime of Shah that Amir Taheri is longing for, because he owned Keyhan during that regime was not any better and Islamic Revolution was justified. Look at how they intriduce Amir Taheri in both this article and in New York Post. "Based in Europe memeber of Benador Associates". Is Europe that small? Is that a small town? Why don't they say based in the world journalist. Or may be he is having a breakfast in London with Christian Amanpour and James Rubin, eating lunch in Jerusalem, and having some lectures and dinner with anti Irani Jews in Forest Hills, New York in between emailing his full of hatred articles to New York Post. Isn't this stupid? How can you saysomebody is based in Europe or Asia or Africa?

The recent spates of edits to Hull really do seem to be in good faith and aren't clear-cut vandalism; it's more peacockism and too much detail, along with the frustration of little things like having to correct source formatting for consistency and the poor/inconsistent use of edit summaries, after entreaties on talk pages receive no response. For instance, another IP you've tagged has been active today since my last edit to the article, all edits are similar to what I just describe.

0	   Withdrawn charges   The London Free press also reported that his charges were withdrawn silently. Now from the perspective of a normal criminal process, this usually means the police had a weak case. The fact that the police were gung-ho about this case may also suggest that the police had no case at all (judging by the seemingly high-profile aspect to this case). In other words, Homeontherange's addition of that information is a pretty clear sign that the information is being added in order to disparage James Scott Richardson.  What is my point of reference? Well. When I added information to Alex Kulbashian and Richard Warman about a Canadian Human Rights Commission complaint file by Alex against Richard, Homeontherange removed the information stating that the complaint could have been filed, however it wasn't serious enough to because there was no evidence the Commissioner signed off on it. Now, getting back to this case, the crown attorney and/or withdrew the charges because there was no prospect for conviction.  To Homeontherange: If you are going to have double standards in "enforcing" wikipedia's criteria for information posted in articles, then that shows your political motivation behind your edits and the way you handle your "administrative" tasks. That would be classified as Administrator Abuse Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_abuse. Furthermore, the fact that the IP address 72.136.34.96 spontaneously lost the ability to make edits without logging in with no explanation could also show a certain level of abuse of administrative rights (by the way. Will be reporting that to Jimbo Wales). So feel free to revert the edit I've made, but make an attempt to justify your actions this time.

BhaiSaab has had it set three times... hello there is a difference here. Kindly refrain from calling me a troll. As  I am not a troll.

0	Those sections were incredibly huge and unwieldy. They needed to be trimmed. A large swath was removed. The burden of proof should be on the person re-introducing them. We can't just add in everything that might be tangentially related to the ZGM. For practical purposes it was just too huge and of no use to our readers. Pic the top absolutely most important and go with those.   In regards BSD and Anarchism and issues related to love and sex, those are far too tangential. If someone at one time asked a question about Jacques Cartier, does that mean we should have a link for him under see also? And remember, this article is not about a RBE. It's about the TZM's advocacy of a RBE. There's a huge difference. Criticism sections should be about TGM and their views. Not about the larger issues they bring up. This is the same as any other page. For instance, a religious organization could have a "criticism" sections and include anything that might potentially fall under the broader discussions relating to religion (which could be a lot of things). Same thing goes for Further Reading. If there's a book or article dealing with TGM, then add them. Adding sources that just talk about RBE or broader social or economic issues is too broad.

0	 July 2014 (UTC) :::::I didn't say that the summary= attribute is not working; I said that it was marked as obsolete. Obsolete in this instance means that browsers claiming compliance with HTML 5 need not support it, and people writing pages that claim compliance with HTML 5 should not use it. But most browsers that support HTML 5 also support HTML 4, not just because it will take a long time for everybody with a website to rewrite the content for HTML 5 (if it ever happens: there are still a lot of HTML 2.0 or 3.2 compliant pages out there that would fail a conformance check for HTML 4, let alone HTML 5), but also because HTML 5 has not yet reached the W3C Recommendation stage, so the current stable standard is HTML 4.01. :::::On some discussion pages (I know of at least three threads outside of User talk: space) there is a scaremonger going around telling people to stop using the  element ASAP, because it's marked as obsolete in HTML 5.

0	 :I redirected it as it was just plot summary, and not really "deserving" of being it's own page. So I moved the plot summary to the episode list and redirected the article here. Similar treatment will be given for Slayers special, but the episode summarys need reducing in size massively first. I haven't done that as I need to rewatch it first. As for it being barely mentioned, this is due to the way the article is being edited rather then anything else. Basically I've been doing things here and there, just adding release dates and sources etc as I get a few minutes and come across them. By all means add any relevant, properly sourced material you think it useful (such as release details, directors etc), but it's unlikely it will benefit from going back to being a seperate article. It's definately not a question of favouritism or anything else, it's just a work in progress. Unfortunately Slayers isn't a priority for my editing, so it's very much stop/start at this end. I'm happy to provide example pages if it helps.

0	, 30 May 2008 (UTC)  Brews, he's given citations for the very things that I have been arguing about. Polar coordinates in the inertial frame are the correct and standard way to analyze planetary orbital motion.  The section that I put in yesterday was standard textbook planetary orbital theory. I mentioned Goldstein's.  I can only conclude that most of the editors here are schoolboys who have done the basic circular motion theory and are totally unwilling to examine the general cases of curved path motion such as ellipses and hyperbolae and the role of the radially outward centrifugal force.  I would say that my section was erased yesterday for no other reason than that nobody here could understand it since they have never done planetary orbital theory in advanced applied maths at university.  And in true schoolboy style, anything that they can't understand must go to the trash can.  05:22

Belligerence and WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT, are two common positions after a block, yes. I will review to see if I am falling in that simplistic behavior. Meanwhile notice that I am not saying that the block didn't make sense. I am saying that it doesn't make sense now. Well, now that I think, the block was done after a post in which I was telling her that if she was stopping with her problems (her problems are not with me or about posting things about me) I also "forgive her"(=stop hounding her). The block is not stopping me from hounding her, since there is now nothing to be stopped. That is why I think it lost its purpose already. Notice that for a hound there is no difficulty in just moving to the next computer, opening a new account and continue barking. And besides, what time is it? Less than 6 hours before the end of the block? Blocks are to make all continue with the enjoyment of Wiki-editing. Mbz1 went astray from her enjoyment of her usual wiki-editing going into problems that she can not handle but now she is back to the pictures and calmed articles.

0	There is a very odd line toward the bottom of this page that reads "GENIVA PORT OF ITALY(AMAN KUMAR)".  I lived in Genova for some years, and as far as I know there is no "Geniva port". In any case "geniva" is meaningless in Italian (though it's similar to "gengiva", the word for gums, as in mouth).  Also, what is an "Aman Kumar"? Is it the author of this line, and the rather arbitrary list of marinas that follow it? A number of important marinas are missing from the list, which is hardly in the spirit of Wikipedia's goal of accuracy and completeness. kentfx

Having its own section with each point starred is not NPOV.  Also, there must an attempt to provide the reasons FOR her nomination also, that was not present.  Also, the comments were conclusionary, they did not provide the reasoning.  For example, the LA Times quote stated that she is bad.  Whoa!  That's an elementary school argument.  There was no explanation on WHY JRB is so "bad."  that is NOT a NPOV presentation.  So go ahead provide the arguments and thinking against JRB, but provide the arguments and thinking FOR JRB also.

0	   WIKIPEDIA IS !   It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.  Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.  As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.  The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.  It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.  The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.  No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.  I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it had be 2009 False user blocked dev 0 157414655.0 , 12 September 2007 (UTC)  I am deeply embarrassed that I carelessly used this offensive phrase: ""Turn up your hearing aid"".

0	While it's interesting that you think that Vodka originates from Poland (and personally, I don't care where it's from), you can't just add unsourced information to an article.  If you wish to add this information to the article, then edit it neatly into the article and provide reliable and verifiable sources for your information.

0	::::Wikipedia should have a neutral point of view. Neutral point of view is a fundamental Wikipedia principle. NPOV is absolute and non-negotiable.  But in articles such as prophecy only your point of view is allowed, the skeptics point of view. Don't you think the article would be improved if both points of view were shown there without bias?
0	Actually Mary II was Queen of Scotland as Mary II. Monarchs stopped being called king/queen of s only afte 1707. And the UK is only used after 1801 for the UK of GB & I. So Mary II was Queen of England & Scotland, not of the UK.  06:32 Mar 3, 2003 (UTC)~

0	  Hi there!.. I'm just curious by your recent entry in the Philology introduction. "The commonality, not the origin or age, of any studied languages, is important, thought those factors are important."... Could you add maybe one more line to define what you mean by 'commonality'? Do you mean: commonality of academic opinion? agreed upon terms of what the a particualr word might mean in a historical context? And I'm guessing that the factors you indicate that are important are the origin and age of any given word. I really cant quite see what you might think was insulting about the introduction... (I didnt write it by the way)... I think the point of the intro was to define where the word 'philology' came from... In latin it means 'grammatica'... Greek? I recall that 'philo' means love, and 'logo' ... well i dont know... But the origin of the word i imagine can have a number of sources... That is what makes words interesting and vibrant to me. I hope you can help clarify my question. I just think your entry could open a whole other line of questioning about the nature of philology. It is why i entered the concept that Nietzsche was a radical philologist... Anyway, some food for thought...

0	 ::: I clarified the above comment somewhat.  public v. non-public applies equally on both projects, but is separate from notability.  (Public figures expressly give up certain rights to privacy, by the nature of their jobs.)  The equivalent to "notability" on commons is "part of an image/file that has plausible educational use".  Yes, there a similar guideline could be proposed here that people who ask for their articles to be removed would be refused only where the article was sufficiently important to justify the refusal. –

0	  Kurdistan?  Kurdistan is not a geo-political region. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iraq. There's a region called Kurdistan in Iran. There's no region called Kurdistan in Turkey. That's akin to placing an Algeristan in France, and making an article that treats it like a country. There are some country articles on wiki that list less facts than a supposed region. Kurds are a minority in Turkey, just like the Hispanics in USA or Algerians in France. As ludicrous as it would seem to place a Mexicistan or Algeristan on those countries where those minorities are heavily populated in, it is to list a Kurdistan that includes Turkish territory. As long as we don't declare San Diego Mexicistan, which Mexico actually did own at one point and not just have a ripped-up treaty claiming it, it is equally ridiculous to list Kurdistan in Turkey. In Iraq, a country that was set up by the British merging 3 territories, a region called Kurdistan warrants an article, as the Kurds were just placed together with other ethnicities by a colonizing force. But I call BS on Turkey being listed under Kurdistan, as Turkey does not have a region named Kurdistan, and Kurds are Turkish citizens, not living under a Kurdish "state" like in Iraq, whom prints their own passports and such.

0	  ::Ah, wait.  I think I see what TallMagic is talking about.  He's saying that the ODA advises site visitors that the [www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation/Search.asp Office of Postsecondary Education] of the United States Department of Education has questionable accuracy in its database of accredited U.S. colleges.  But, we are to blindly accept that an Archive.org snapshot of the Oregon ODA is infallible, even better and more perfect than a very similar database kept by the United States government.  We're to believe that it's important for Wikipedia to assert that WIU was "operating illegally", even though this charge was never mentioned in any news source of any kind, even though this charge was never filed in any court in Pennsylvania or any court in any jurisdiction in the world.  And we're to take this on the word of someone who has been lambasting unaccredited institutions across the Internet for decades, who can't find a single like-minded editor other than an admin with whom he shares 90% of their joint editing activity on articles dealing with unaccredited institutions.    ::The phrase "operating illegally" occurs 44 times in Wikipedia article space. I count 12 of those 44 where the phrase is used to describe the phenomenon of an unaccredited educational organization.  I wonder if I searched the history of those 12 articles, would I find that either TallMagic or his partner admin Orlady have added that phrase "operating illegally" to Wikipedia, and whether the source will be cited, and if so, will it be a mainstream media report that asserts the importance, or whether it will be an Archive.org snapshot of this purportedly infallible Oregon state website?  I think I'll go check those 12 articles now, and I'll report what I find either here, or in an Administrator's Notice.

0	A few weeks ago, in anticipation of Millennium Park regaining its featured topic status, I broached the idea of CUP credit after the last article was promoted and you indicated that credit would not be granted.  It is my belief that I misrepresented the work done to regain Featured Topic status at a time when one last article was needed.  It is also my belief that you rendered a decision that getting credit for getting one last article promoted was gaming the system. You noted that this type of credit was dangerous territory for the cup.  Clearly, just having articles added to a topic or repromoting a deleted topic could be gaming the system, but when a rule change requires taking a 17-article topic from 1/3rd  to 1/2 Featured content, it is not a matter of gaming the system.  The winner of this contest could come down to whether you grant me Featured Topic points for Wikipedia:Featured topics/Millennium Park. I earned FT points for this topic when it was first promoted.  At that time the topic was 15 articles and the requirement was that 1/3 of the articles be WP:FC and all be at least WP:GA.  Thus, I was acknowledged for bringing 5 of 15 topics to featured status.  However, during the year two articles (Park Grill and Grant Park Music Festival) were added to the topic and the requirement was increased to 1/2 of the articles needing to be featured. Thus, I had to ensure that the two new articles be promoted to good article (which I did without a lapse in topic status) and that a total of 9 of the 17 articles reached featured.  Thus, I helped raise McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink (March 23), Harris Theater (Chicago) (June 12), Millennium Park (August 31) and Exelon Pavilions (September 25) to featured.  Promoting two GAs and 4 FAs is more work than most people have to do to get a new FT. ///WP:CHICAGO/WP:FOUR)

If you weren't happy with that, then I would have discussed it. : But as you seem happy with it now, as you haven't reverted it, then there isn't any problem.     ::Just because they don't, doesn't mean you shouldn't. Old saying, "do as I say not as I do" comes to mind. In other words, do as Wikipedia says, not as other editors do, and you can't really go wrong.  ::It's not a case of being happy with it, I just don't want to edit war over it.

Like I said, if it was reverted a second time I would have said why it should have been included on the talk page. I'm not going to waste my time. I added an edit in and then later found a source for it. Paranormal romance is currently the only genre there with a source. As we are using our own opinions on the page, you don't believe paranormal romance should be included as there are too many genres, l well I personally think "fantasy" could go. The story is focusing more on paranormal romance than it is on the fantasy, it is inspired by the love story Romeo and Juliet.    ::::Good idea. I'll get rid of it.

0	March 2008 (UTC)  :::I think you are both right. An ethnic group is a group of people with a subjective belief in a common descent (or if you like the perception of a common descent). To be an ethnic group a group does not have to have an actual common descent, only the belief in a common descent. There's also the meaning of descent, in anthropology descent does not by necessity have have to have a biological reality, some ethnic groups claim a common descent from gods, or totems. So I think that the English certainly are an ethnic group/nation because they have a perceived common ancestry.   09:25, 16

0	I, as a person of Scottish heritage, really admire Richard Mackay and the hope he summons in the hearts of Scottish football fans. To delete this topic would be an attack on our nation.

Every true fan of football has heard of Richard Mackay. Only the ignorant could deny his significant contribution to football, and Scottish culture as a whole.
0	  Speedy deletion of Molly Sanchez  A tag has been placed on Molly Sanchez requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A1 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because it is a very short article providing little or no context to the reader. Please see Wikipedia:Stub for our minimum information standards for short articles. Also please note that articles must be on notable subjects and should provide references to reliable sources that verify their content.   If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or "db" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the article does get deleted, you can contact one of these admins to request that a copy be emailed to you.

0	  Thomas Nelson, Sr.  Does anyone know whether or not Mr. Thomas Nelson, Sr., age 111, currently residing in Texas, formerly of Louisiana, served in the military before, during or after World War I?  Can anyone provide any further biographical information on Mr. Nelson  where he was born, where he lives now, etc.?  Finally, can anyone post links to any articles about Mr. Nelson?  Any information would be appreciated.  Well, let's look at what Ancestry says:- There are 13 Draft Cards for WWI for a Thomas Nelson, of Louisiana 6 of which fit into the age category. There are other bits & pieces of information that can then be found from there, providing that is the correct info. Have you got any more details - middle name, initial, date of birth etc. to help us so we can help you?  Why speculate?  It was never mentioned anywhere that he is a WWI veteran.  He runs a candy store.  However, Silas Simmons is a closer candidate, based on what he said about 'loading ammunition' during WWI (at the shipyards).   :Why speculate?  Because he's in the right age range, and if there's a chance he served we sould check it out.  What's this about him running a candy store?  Thomas Nelson spent most of his life running a candy store.  He doesn't strike me as someone who would have served.  He is African-American.  →  {ł}   "Doesn't strike you?"  Keep in mind the draft was in full force at the time, it didn't matter what you did.     :I agree  that kind of speculation is bizarre.  If you had the opportunity to meet and talk with him, Robert, why didn't you just ask him if he'd served?  What is it about running a candy store that makes someone unlikely to be called up for the draft?  Does he have a draft card on file?  One would think that if he served, the news article would have mentioned it.  But I find your statements hypocritical vis-a-vis the Silas Simmons comment.   Silas Simmons?  :Who is Silas Simmons?  Silas Simmons was born Oct 14 1895, according to his WWI draft card:  Name: Silas Joseph Simmons  City: Philadelphia   County: Philadelphia   State: Pennsylvania   BirthPlace: Delaware   Birth Date: 14 Oct 1895   Race: African   Roll: 1907647   DraftBoard: 27    →  {ł}   http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/16/Neighborhoodtimes/A_senior_among_seniors.shtml  Note: During both World War I and World War II, he loaded live ammunition for U.S. troops onto ships bound for Europe.  He is not on the GRG list because the 1900 census lists him as born in '1897' (which would make him 'only' 108, instead of 110 as claimed).  However, it's possible the census in this case is incorrect.  In any case, he was still alive a month ago, has a WWI draft card, and participated in an activity which was directly related to the war effort.  Whether he is a 'veteran' or not, I don't know if he was drafted.  But considering some 'veterans' on the current list were little more than telephone operators and ROTC students, Silas's efforts were a tangible contribution to the war.  He was also a Negro league ballplayer.→  {ł}   :This is not a discussion of the relative merits of peoples' service.  It's merely a question of service.  A veteran is someone who served in the armed forces; it's irrelevant where he or she served and what exactly they did.

0	  :::::: The phonology of Urdu appears to be different enough from that of Hindi because of (however artificial) phonemes not, for instance, present in Hindi as they are of Persian derivation. WP:CFORK simply does not apply because here is not a case of (I quote the "this page in a nutshell" box) "Articles should not be split into multiple articles just so each can advocate a different stance on the subject", since there is no "stance" to be taken, it's just a matter of Urdu phonology being different from Hindi phonology. If you want the differences between Urdu and Hindi phonology to be more prominently highlighted than they are now you can, as I said, do it yourself (you can't expect to force others to add content, surely). As to code-switching, for other languages this seems to be tackled by having a separate article about the common code-switching mixtures (Spanglish and so on) and linking them in the "See also" sections, so feel free to do this if you want, for what I'm concerned.

0	  Eisenhower and McCarthy Below is some proposed language for the Ike/McCarthy subhead; I've placed it here because it contains a lot of "perhaps'es", but hopefully it's illumintating. :President Dwight D. Eisenhower due to his past close association with General Omar Bradley may have been apprised of the existence of the Venona project, the secret program within the U.S. Army Signals Intelligence Service decrypting KGB messages originating in the United States.  Eisenhower's former chief of intelligence and the first head of the CIA, General Walter Beedle Smith may have been brought in on the secret too, and the CIA began recieving some decrypted information in 1953.  There is no indication Eisenhower's Attorney General Herbert Brownell, Jr. was made aware of the highly secret information. This may explain why Eisenhower was willing to leave McCarthy barking up the wrong trees.

0	   Request assistance deleting old talk page   Greetings. two of the Wikipedia Sysops (or whatevery you call them here), refuse to let me delete the content of my talk page, for reasons that go beyond my understanding. Some of the material in the talk page is personal. The page includes rough drafts with mistakes that I never intended to make permanent. Had I known I would not be allowed to delete this material, I would never have posted it in the first place.  You recently archived part of the page, which is fine, of course. I told you at that time that I planned to clear the whole page, as I do from time to time. You raised no objection, and it never occured to me that anyone would object, but apparently these other two sysops do object. I would appreciate it if you could take steps to clear the page. If you want to keep a copy of any material there for your own purposes, please feel free to do so.

Even if we find that the International Organization for the Identification and Monitoring of Hate Groups has conducted their extensive peer review and has identified Conservapedia as the hate group they are, there's no way to cite that in a tag. Ergo, the tags are clearly meant to be based on common sense, not on citations. Furthermore, if the rules of wikipedia prevent us from adding accurate information to an article, then the rules should be ignored. That's not my ideait's Wikipedia's: "If a rule prevents you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia, ignore it." Not adding information because the site is not "important enough" seems far more of an unsubstantiated value judgment than anything I've said.

When US presidents reaffirm the "One China" principle, they are in accordance with their country's official policy, it's not a mistake nor does it create controversy.

0	Having done some research on MEND and other east African insurgent groups since my first edit in late April, I'd be happy to see legitimate counterarguments against MEND's activities. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find any; it really does look like this is a situation where they are the "least bad" of multiple organizations doing questionable things and I think the article should represent that. We shouldn't shy away from discussing what they do wrong (armed insurrection for one, kidnapping and holding of innocent hostages for another) but the fact that Shell is up against the Alien Tort Law in US courts right now for the alleged despoiling of the Niger delta might yield better information as to this issue as it wends its way through discovery and trial.

0	  Thanks for the warning. the difference between the above and apersonal attack is that the above can be demonstrated factually via formal logic. I don't know who you think you are pushing around, but you started the attacks on MY page, against me, by intimating that i was ignorant.  The fact is, you are ignorant, and the further fact is, your ignorant attack against me is so ignorant, that it constitutes proof that you shouldn't be voting. You aren't actually reading the sources and references provided. So start reading the sources and the references provided, and get back to me. Don't threaten me, don't tell me what to do, and DON'T think you can turn anything i say into a logical argument that i am making "personal attacks."

0	   Further tidy up required   The lead paragraph says that this is a list of "major" hospitals in Karachi. I have discussed the list with a colleague who did her medical training in Karachi. She says that the Public Institutions are major hospitals and that most of the Dental Surgeries are not. She went through the list of Private Institutions and marked the ones she knew to be major - unfortunately I can't do anything to the article based on her list as that would be WP:OR. I haven't deleted any of the institutions and we really need someone who has the time (and reads Urdu) to go through the list and look for sources. I have tidied up the mixture of bold and non-bold text and have removed addresses where I could. I have also heavily cut the Dental Surgeries to just the three that appear to be hospitals.

This is not a deal breaker for GA, but it would certainly add to the article's aesthetics. * Could one more sentence be added to the lede regarding the distinguishing design features of the Osvetnik class submarines? * The lede is otherwise well-written, consists of content that is adequately sourced and verifiable, and I have no other comments or questions for this section.  Description and construction * I suggest starting out the first paragraph of this section by explicitly naming the Osvetnik class. * While this is a separate matter from this article and its GA qualifications, are there plans in the works to craft an article on the Simonot design? * Should Maschinenfabrik be spelled out either in parentheses after "MAN" or with "MAN" in parentheses after Maschinenfabrik? * The section is otherwise well-written, consists of content that is adequately sourced and verifiable, and I have no other comments or questions for this section.  Service history * I suggest adding a comma after "On 14 September 1943." * On 10 April, Osvetnik and Hrabri received orders for an operation, but operation did not proceed. Is this because they were subsequently captured by the Italian XVII Corps? If so, this should be made explicit in the prose. * There should be a wiki-link to Scuttling in the prose for those readers not familiar with this act of deliberately sinking a ship. * The section is otherwise well-written, consists of content that is adequately sourced and verifiable, and I have no other comments or questions for this section.

0	  The second sentence reads "Research by the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS) shows roughly double the rate of depression and anxiety, among young adults who also report an abusive or unsupportive upbringing". Abusive or unsupportive upbringing ≠ dysfunctional family. I never said that self help books are fringe theories. I said that the idea of there being  six basic roles is a fringe theory. And I think it's quite obvious from the title that "Forgiving Our Parents: For Adult Children from Dysfunctional Families" is a self help book.

0	  ::WRT "innocent"  this is not a "verified fact".   ::# Does the Chinese government agree they are "innocent"?  No. ::# The DoJ appealed Urbina's ruling on Razakah's habeas.  Did they think he is "innocent"? ::# Urbina wasn't ruling on Razakah's "innocence".  None of the habeas rulings were on whether the captives were "innocent" of a crime.  None of the Uyghurs were charged with a crime.  All of the habeas rulings were on whether the "preponderance of the evidence" supported the Executive Branch claim that it was justified to hold them because the were enemies of the USA, or had supported al Qaeda.  ::The first Uyghur to get a ruling was Huzaifa Parhat.  His 2008-06-20 ruling was in the only DTA appeal to run to conclusion.  The Executive Branch considered appealing that ruling.  The Executive Branch had a schedule of when it had to file factual returns in the Uyghurs' habeas cases.  The Uyghur's factual returns were due in October.  In those factual returns they would have been obliged to lay out valid evidence to justify the Uyghur's detention.  It is important to quote our sources accurately.  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were "innocent".  The DoJ did not acknowledge that the Uyghurs were not, after all, "enemy combatants".  The DoJ simply said that they were changing their plans, and would not put forward arguments that the Uyghurs were "enemy combatants".  Some commentators went on record as interpreting this change of plans not as an acknowledgment that the Uyghurs weren't enemies, but merely as a strategic decision that the value of establishing that the Uyghurs were enemy combatants was insufficient to justify making classified sources public.  ::Personally, I agree, that the Uyghurs were wrongfully imprisoned.  But I understand that personal opinions like that don't belong in article space.  The wikipedia is not supposed to be used for advocacy.  We shouldn't rewrite history to improperly imply the Uyghur's "innocence" has been an established fact. ::*As I have explained to you before, if you find Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina. ::*If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine quotes Urbina's ruling, and he used that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  properly attributed to Urbina. ::*If an WP:RS, like a newspaper or legal magazine, in summarizing Urbina's ruling, uses that phrase, you can include the phrase in the article  attributed to the WP:RS, not to Urbina. ::*If you find Urbina's ruling, and he used a different phrase, like, "...the USA has no legal justification to hold Razakah...", you are stuck using that phrase, even if other judges used the phrase "wrongfully imprisoned" in other habeas rulings.  ::WRT where to find the DoJ's appeal...  A reference to the CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard was offered right in the paragraph where I added that the ruling in his habeas was appealed.  The CCR's Guantanamo habeas scorecard has a column for whether a habeas ruling was appealed.  That column in Razakah's entry says his ruling was appealed.  I urge you to double check references more carefully before claiming assertions were unreferenced.  ::WRT his "innocence", you assert above: "There is hardly anybody now who doubt this..."  this is an argument based on common knowledge.  Further, your draft asserted that their innocence was established "early".  We don't base our articles on common knowledge, or our personal opinions as to what is common knowledge, we base them on what we can verify from authoritative reliable sources.

I've got questions about your recent edits to the stub templates that I added to several stub articles I wrote (part of a personal effort to add all historic districts in Arlington County, Virginia, USA to Wikipedia).  See, e.g., your edit to Prospect Hill (Arlington, Virginia).  I understand why you replaced my use of struct-sub with the more specific U.S.-struct-sub (thanks!).    However, you also eliminated the Virginia-geo-stub I used.  Is this because the geo-stub and its subcategories are only for geographic features, and sites of historic houses (even when those houses no longer stand on site) don't qualify?  If that's the reason, how are geographic features defined?  Clearly they must include natural features (e.g. rivers, mountains).  Do they include political geography (e.g. towns, counties)?  What about properties that may include structures but are also comprised of natural or man-made geography (e.g. ranches, canals)?  I'm happy to conform with preferred usage.  (Indeed, I've got some similar uses of the Virginia-geo-stub on Fort Ethan Allen (Arlington, Virginia) and Fort Albany (Arlington, Virginia) that I'm prepared to remove if necessary.)  I only added the Virginia-geo-stub because I thought my stub articles were more likely to attract the help of Wikipedians who cared about Virginia than from Wikipedians who care about U.S. structures.  Thanks in advance for filling me in.     :Thanks for the help, Grutness (at   :   = Politician-stubs monitoring =  Hi Grutness. As you know, I've been trying to create some kind of order in the politician-stub categories, so I've created a new subpage tracking them for potential splits. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any really good lists carving up Africa into smaller segments, so my list is basically a ripoff from one of your old lists regarding the geo-stubs (I've modified the text and the European and Caucasus categories). I really hope that you don't mind, but I figured that my time was better spent counting stubs than designing something clever. I haven't done the counts for all the subcategories yet, but I have done most of them. Besides, I figured that if we one day start splitting up Africa into smaller fragments, it would be nice with consistency between the politician-stubs and the geo-stubs. I still don't know if it will be necessary, but it's always nice to have the option. Again, I hope you don't mind the ripoff, if you do, I'll redesign the page or kill it asap. Best regards.     :Thanks for the reply. I'm not sure it is a good idea at all to split the African continent into segments (yet) but I'd like to keep the possibility open. It is a lot easier doing counts of 200 stubs from 6 countries than 700 from 40 nations. My main motivation is to see a consistent system for both the geo-stubs, the politician-stubs, and any other type of stub.

0	::::There are a few flood models: Hydroplate, Catastrophic plate tectonics (CPT), Asteroid impacts.  (note: These flood models assume that the Genesis Flood is a fact.)  The Hydroplate model has popular general public interest but few adherents among creationary scientists.  Rains come from water ejected from below crust.  Flooding is also by sinking of continents.  CPT is promoted by some PhD creationary scientists, problems with it are noted by other equally degreed creationists.  Flooding is by tsunami from oceans, rains are a side product.  Asteroid impacts are credited in two models  Asteroid impacts w/CPT and Asteroid impacts w/vertical tectonics.  There are critics of both among creationary scientists.  Flooding is by tsunami from oceans, rains are a side product.  Discussions of these models are found in creationary publications, which are, of course, automatically rejected as FRINGE so....... So all you get are anti-creationists misrepresenting creationists and claiming this is what creationists say.  No one cares what creationists actually say nor why. It's all automatically pseudoscience because everyone knows that creationism is pseudoscience.  It doesn't matter if they are misrepresented or not.  They're FRINGE freaks anyway....

0	  WTF are you talking about?  There is no admin decision against me to not edit gender articles.  I'm full allowed to edit any and all articles.  Not only are you engaging in slanderous accusations, you're telling flat out lies.  I'd say spreading flat out lies which have absolutely not basis in reality against other members is a violation of several Wikipedia policies, so you better be VERY careful about what you say.  I strongly suggest that you retract your slanderous accusation before you further discredit yourself.Why the heck would I make changes under an alternate account when I have the full capability of doing it under this account?    Also, where have I inserted any kind of right wing or religious views here?  Nothing I've said has anything to do with religion nor does it have anything to do with politics.  My points are extremely valid and you only rejected them because of your ridiculous personal biases and need to push your POV.  Not only are transvestites not necessarily transgendered, there are quite a few people on this list who are clearly NOT transvestites even using the description given in the article itself.  I have to question how anyone thought it was a good idea to add them.    I should also note that you're being hypocritical here, you're reverting a change on the basis that it hasn't been discussed, when you yourself refuse to discuss it!  I'd be very interested to know why a) non-transgendered people should be included on a list of transgendered ones and b) why transvestite is used as automatic criteria for seeing if someone is transgendered, even though there is nothing in the definition that indicates that.  Frankly, this kind of behavior is appalling.  The supposedly open minded LGBT Wikipedian cliques criticize "right wing religious" people (and by right-wing religious that means anyone who doesn't agree with their extremist views) is actually one of the most close-minded groups on wikipedia, with the least likely chance of actually discussing things (as evidenced here) and least likely to consider others views.   29 June 2005 22:08 (UTC)

0	      I wholeheartedly disagree with your stance on the subject, I believe there is ample evidence to prove the company under the supervision of the CEO in question was not only constructive but accurate. Terry Semel has ran a company which has gave money to lobby groups which wish to alter the design of the internet to favor profit over ingenuity. This would effectively change the measure for which code is ranked since it would also be determined by its purchased bandwidth priority over performance. This would not only have an effect on those involved in the programming industry but change the way the internet works for the entire world. Now from Wikipedia's own article on the subject an asshole is slang described as "The word is mainly used as a profanity towards someone the speaker does not like or whose behavior is hurtful, self-centered, or particularly abrasive." Now selling out the free world wide accessible library and programming performance for profit is particularly "self-centered" and "hurtful" behavior which influences the world. Since this was done during his career this is where I summarized quite eloquently using words from the culture he himself propagates.

0	::::Firstly, Montanabw, there is no such thing as Equus caballus. That is a domesticated animal. The proper name is Equus ferus caballus - unless domesticated Horses somehow come from Zebras or Asses... Also, there is no consensus that Equus ferus ever set foot on the North American continent, though I personally believe Equus lambei may be a subspecy of Equus ferus. Thirdly, and most importantly, and I hope EVERYONE is listening here when I say this, Equus ferus caballus, the domesticated Horse IS NO MORE native to the North American west than Chihuahuas are to the Canadian tundra. Domestic forms are native NOWHERE. Period. The domestic Horse is RADICALLY different from it's wild ancestor. And Dysmorodrepanis, the reason all the Equine articles are so Horse-centric is because a very large number of vociferous (and outright foolish) people are unhealthily obsessed with horses. Unfortunately, many of these people also think themselves expert enough to declare a domestic animal native to a continent it never inhabited simply because they like to watch them run. Seriously, that's all it is. They like looking at them. It's certainly not an environmental issue. Horses are wildly destructive to their surroundings. They eat more than cattle! And an obscene amount more than the native Pronghorn (which, by the way doesn't trample its food to death like the Mustangs do with they're enormous, heavy-stepping hooves). The only argument the Mustang and Burro worshippers have to use (and they milk it good, let me tell ya) is the similarity of Equus lambei to Equus ferus. But, Equus lambei has not been proven to be synonymous with Equus ferus (though it is a possibility), and even if it were it would be more closely related, by far, to Przewalski's Horse than to Mustangs! E. lambei was tiny! It was like four feet tall at the shoulders! And all the other North American Equids are pretty well-known to not be synonyms with Equus ferus (including E. caballus). Not by a long shot. This is why the Horse Evolution page (and every other page dealing with equines) has been changed back and forth so many times. The people who know what the heck they're talking about try to add useful information and correct blatant lies or grievous mistakes and the people who like pretty ponies go back and try to convince the world that Spanish horses have roamed every continent including Antarctica, Mars and the Sun since before Dinosaurs walked on two feet. I made the ridiculous mistake of trying to add factual information to the Mustang article and, if I remember correctly, it was changed WITHIN THE HOUR. The person doing the changing even removed the scientific names I inserted! The Mustang article has absolutely no indication of what specy the Mustang belongs to now! I swear this endless struggle between the My Little Ponyites and REAL BIOLOGISTS is like the Evolution vs. creationism argument, only dumber. Like I said, these people aren't calling for us to turn our rotweillers loose into the nearest forest, but why not? I mean, it's the same specy as the Gray Wolf. Domestication doesn't matter, if you listen to these people. If that's the case then why aren't we restocking mature Oak forests with farm raised white turkeys? I mean, it's the same specy, after all. Oh. And this is my favourite. Where Wild Asses are actually native they're critically endangered. But I have not read ONE WORD from the Cult of the Mustang and Burro about saving them from ACTUAL extinction, but get this, they want to have the Mustangs and Burros in America declared endangered species. How's that for mentally inept and savagely hypocritical?
0	   Article   I just read through the state of the article. A couple things, first is I agree that it seems to emphasize blogging (even in the title of the section) and seems to skirt over the vast majority of your traditional reporting. I intend to rewrite that section, is there a way I could get a list of links to articles you've written, either on fox or elsewhere? The fact that you have dropped some entries on Fox's blog should probably stay in there, but just as a note and the section as a whole, including the title, should probably focus on your career as a journalist. Second, I didn't quite understand "The lede says I'm an "embed on assignment in Iraq". I've spent just as much time in Iraq." Could you possibly explain what you meant there? I could just be dense, but it left me confused. And the Ann Coulter photo... Is it under a free license? If so I don't really see a need to remove it. Any chance you can show me the diff that pulled it out? Thanks.   :What Matt seems to have said is that he's spent about equal amounts of time as a reporter in Afghanistan as in Iraq. ''''   ::: I have spent roughly an equal amount of time in Afghanistan and Iraq.    *The entries at the Fox Blog are meant to promote the articles.

0	:Very quickly for the moment, given the level of kneejerk controversy that attends topics like this one, it will be necessary to provide citations for the assertions that these myths are parallel.  I know they're out there.  Once that is done, the superfluous material can be weeded out, and perhaps, just perhaps, one ends up with an article about parallel myths, which can then be appropriately retitled so it more accurately represents the topic actually dealt with, which presently is a series of analogous or parallel myths to such myths as virgin birth, son of God, resurrection, miraculous cures, etc.  Note carefully that I'm not making an assertion whether these primarily scriptural stories are accurate or not.  But I am making an assertion that if there are asserted to be parallel myths, the assertions that they are parallel or closely analogous, or identical, or whatever, need to be cited, and not just arrived at by the WP writers because it seems obvious.  Believe it or not, it's an important WP principle.  So if this material is useful and properly WP:A'd, I'm certain there is a place for it in some appropriate article on WP.  ...

I have not followed this article, and may just be behind on recent events. But this seems odd to me. Of course, it may also, unbeknownst to me, be the standard way of indexing Arabic names - I doubt it however, seeing that his sons were named Hussein, not Saddam, indicating that Hussein is indeed the name to index. However, before I do any reverting, I'll see what everybody says about this. I'll also ask the editor in question to comment on this discussion.   •  •  count)

0	   The Riflemen's Song at Bennington   Removed:  However an isolated earlier use of this term relating to the American War of Independence appears in "The Riflemen's Song at Bennington", an old folk song that supposedly goes back to the 1770s.   Which does indeed refer to the 1777 Bennington Battle but there is nothing to date the song, particularly the Red Coat version. Possibly the original lyric was: "Why come ye hither, stranger? Your mind what madness fills? In our valleys there is danger, And danger on the hills" which seems to have become "Why come ye hither, Redcoats, your mind what madness fills? In our valleys there is danger, and there's danger on our hills." for the Burl Ives collection Historical America in Song from 1950.  But without definite sources it reads like WP:OR

0	  Other asians like phillipinos score significantly less (around 90).  It is difficult to explain how the environment, racial bias, etc. could explain these consistent differences which show up all across the world.  Rushton continues this line and says that there are other traits which differ between groups.  He dichotimizes it into 3 races to make a point.  He could as easily done it with 4, 5, 6 , 7 or infinite races.  As humans we need to categorize things because that is the only way we can make sense of the world.  Technically every organism in the world could in theory be it's own "race" since everyone differs slightly from the next.  No two creatures are exactly alike (for the most part).  Putting things into categories is arbitrary because every living thing is related to each other by differing degrees.  Fish, birds, mammals etc. all had a common ancestor and are all related to each other by varying degrees.  It is only in the human mind that there are clear demarcations between anything.  However, in the real world these differences are meaningful to us and categorization is necessary.

0	 **Between when I left the request and when you replied here you've made 6 edits to 3 articles, including 3 edits to The Real Housewives of Orange County. It does not matter that the table "has been there the longest". If it doesn't comply with our policies and guidelines it needs to be fixed, not left in a non-compliant format. I am clearly not the only one complaining about the table. Numerous editors have attempted to change this and similar tables at various articles and you've reverted them without explanation. That's edit-warring, which can result in you being blocked from editing. There's even a Request for Comment open at WT:TV. However, even if I was the only one complaining, that's irrelevant. It just happens that I noticed the lack of compliance. Removing bolding from the table is simply not enough; the table needs to fully comply, which means incorporating row and column scopes, plainrowheaders, and fixing capitalisation problems as a minimum. There are numerous errors in the table that should also be fixed. You're obvioulsy aware of the existence of errors as you have fixed some yourself. As for being "easier to understand, easier to read, catches the eye better", the two tables are almost visually identical, so those are not valid reasons. The only visual differences are the capitalisation and column width fixes and better compliance with MOS:COLOR. From an editorial standpoint, the compliant table is much easier to read and update. That's why a similarly formatted table was removed from American Idol and a note left on your page by another editor.

0	Just a minor point of clarification: It was orignally stated "While at the book signing, which was also a party to celebrate Mimi's 21st birthday, Farina saw a guest with a motorcycle and went for a ride up Carmel Valley Road..." This is actually not true - the book-signing and the birthday party were separate events. After the book-signing, the couple attended a party held at Pauline Bryan’s (Joan & Mimi’s sister) house nearby. It was there that Farina saw a guest, Willie Hinds, with a motorcycle, and left to take a ride.  David Hadju’s book (written in cooperation with Mimi Farina) contains a very detailed account of that day.

0	:Hey. I meant to thank you for your stance, but I guess I was carried away downstream while being called a dick, a harasser and what not... Mast, there is a problem with excessive deletions. A huge problem. And I'm afraid it's largely fueled by people becoming increasingly hooked on that little endorphin kick they get as they blow away an image or article, and when they talk down to and then ban those who get uppity in defense of same. It's at epidemic proportions and I decided I had to get some attention for it... Review my edits, keeping in mind that the couple dozen edits involved in the creation, polishing and sustaining of entire articles (like my first, Whitechapel) is worth several hundreds, or even thousands, of janitorial edits. I'm no troll. These people are treating me like one with very little serious discussion on their end and, yes, now that they've lost it completely and have banned me, they're in for some serious scrutiny down the line.

If people want to discredit something they don't understand that is ok.  this being said is in no way directed to anyone in particular.  I just find it interesting that people want to write up document reports on religions that they are no part of.  There are pages on Cathlics, Baptist, and other religions that state opinions of people who are not even a part of those religions.  To me and this is personal it is very sad when there are people who will 'critically analzye something that they do not believe in themselves.  oh well.
0	Hello, . While there had been some discussion here about whether your username met Wikipedia policy on what usernames editors can use, the result was to allow it, and that discussion has now been closed. If you would like to see what concerns were raised, you can still find that discussion in the archive.  You do not need to change your username. However, if you ever wish to do so, it is possible for you to keep your present contributions history under a new name: simply request a new name here following the guidelines on that page, rather than creating a whole new account. Thank you.    (Need help?
1	Erik, for crying out loud. You legally can have sex with children, but not with underage children. Underage children are children beneath the legal age of consent (different states have 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 as the underage limit. Children in most countries means someone under the age of 18. In Ireland for example, a 'child' aged 17 is over the age of consent. In Britain it is 16. Do you know the first thing about the topic?   The name is standard english asage. Scandal is a POV term. Allegation allows the discussion of cases that have not yet come to court, which cannot for technical reasons be prosecuted and cases that were thrown up as invalid. Roman Catholic Church sex abuses allegations in standard english means allegations about the Roman Catholic Church.   Public relations is minor tabloid point when you are discussing the rape of children, so stop adding in an irrelevant topic.   Your mucking around lost a lot of changes, spelling corrections and other problems solved. I was caught in an edit conflict with you and given the scale of the changes could do nothing but a cut and paste job. I then tried to go in to your version to transfer over accurate changes but then you started this insane fucking around with the article's location, using a POV title. I will keep moving back to a carefully worded neutral title.
0	  :Hey  so I see you stopped editing for a while. I am going to replace my comments. Please, for the sake of my sanity (and for your own) do not remove them again. I'm having a tough enough time dealing with the wikistalking as it is without other editors piling on.

0	 *I agree with Aleta that it does merit discussion, because BLP considerations don't apply to cartoon characters.

0	  Victims of Nat Turner rebellion  I agree.  But some would argue the page may not necessarily be racist, but, yes, it certainly is lopsided.  I think some brief, explanatory introduction of what the rebellion is would be helpful.  And if the names of the blacks involved who perished are available, then they certainly should be included.  Even the names of those insurrectionists/freedom fighters who later were executed should be included  and, perhaps, the word "victims" changed to something less value laden.  After all, many of these whites and their families thrived/prospered by victimizing, exploiting and degrading blacks.  They certainly also were "victims"?  And even those insurrectionists who perished because they felt compelled to take matters into their own hands because they could/would no longer tolerate bondage or the dehumanization of their kin as human chattel  were they no less "victims"?

0	    You  are under the influence of a severe WP:COI attack. Remember a COI could be spotted not only by defending but also by attacking a particular project/idea (like you are doing here). You have erased (I think it was you even when that edition it is not signed) the independent links that support the inclusion of SERVA in this page. You have erased links to articles written by many different people from many different languages, you have erased the kind of link you couldn't provide for supporting the projects that you are SPONSORING here. My proposed changes are based in facts that you cannot take (and dare to erase); You are PROMOTING projects here; you do not provide independent sources, then I do not have to convince you. You are definitely biased here.  I want to report  for erasing the research material I have included when supporting one of the projects ERASED by him in this page.   1)  systematiclly refuses to provide the bases for supporting COBBLER inclusion. He does not have/know how to articulate the support for the mentioned project. I encourage  to finally provide to the WP community the supporting material for the inclusion of this project here. He is the one that systematically forces the inclusion of this project; it has to be him who knows and proves to the community the value of the mentioned project. My guideline based argument for removing COBBLER is that that project it is not representative of the PXE state of art.  I want to report  as a biased editor whose behavior could be very well understood under the terms of WP:COI.   2) You cannot say ditto; the guideline based argument for removing EL TORITO  was clearly stated before; you are definitely not WP:LISTENing here. EL TORITO has nothing to do with PXE.   3) Again a magnificent display of WP:COI; your COI. You are trying to twist things putting the blame on me but that will not change facts: There is no independent material available for supporting the inclusion of ERPXE. Peroid. Again it is YOU who scream COI here while supporting one of your projects. Bring the material and I'll shut up. If not it isn't me the one that has to shut up here.   4) your WP:COI is amazing; you cannot take defeat; and no matter what I write you want to promote the projects that you want while banning SERVA. If I bring links you erase the links, if I bring facts and arguments you call me "dead horse". You do not care about WP you just care about not bending your arm. You have no clue about PXE but you pretend to rule how the PXE page is written based on your guts feelings and personal taste. SERVA was included here for long time and it was you who take it down.I think you were just too far.
0	:::I would agree with your point that there is no official policy, but if you examine articles you will see that this is the general layout and agreed upon syntax... it is very much an unofficial policy but one that it still pertinent here. However, that is aside from the fact you don't actually have any evidence of criticism, Germen, as per mine and dab's comments above and on the mediation page. And, you have also started edit warring again, reverting my edits without any comment. Again, for the purposes of peace I ask you to remove the sections in question and return it to dab's version.  |
0	   Extensive Welfare System?   Presently, Singapore can be politically analysed as a democratic socialist country and has an extensive welfare system, although de facto it has a dominant-party system.   We have an extensive welfare system? I know we have no unemployment monetary benefits, no disability monetary benefits, no eldery monetary benefits. (monetary benefits = receiving money from the govt like unemployment claims in developed countries like Australia and the USA)  Wasn't there cases back then where poor families who couldn't scrap up enough money to pay for water and electricity bills were featured on the news, and our govt made a statement like "PUB (public utility board) not running a charity"? *PUB = govt linked monopoly on all public utilities in singapore. They are the only water and electricity provider in the country.  Don't worry, I'm not looking for a flame war nor am I a "govt lackey" lol. I just want to make this wiki entry as accurate as possible. I think it is pretty good that we do not face wars, terror attacks, famine or natural disasters in Singapore. Though crime rate is considerably high (my low is at zero P), its much harder to get killed or raped here than say in the States.  Anyone with knowledge and verifiable sources regarding our "extensive welfare system" please enlightened.

0	    Hello RR. I think the link to the Railway Performance Society should be included for a few reasons. Readers can see what the society is about and whether they think its references and research are worthy. Furthermore, to be frank, the RPS generally at least wants some publicity for using "their" sources and data, which, to be frank, I think is fair enough, its not as if they"re a business in it to make money. If you want to move the link to the reference at the bottom of the page be my guest. I think this is a classic case where an inflexible attitude to Wikipedia"s ""rules"" is counter productive. As I say on my ""User page, we shouldn"t lose sight of why we"re actually here.  On the Cecil J Allen book, it is actually a book which I have in my collection, the full title is ""Locomotive practice & Performance in the 20th Century"", first published by Heffer in 1949.  On the reference thing, my eyes just glaze over when I see that, my brain is already full.... Just as I sometimes edit others grammatical errors, I"m quite happy for others to edit my references if they want !  Incidentally, is there a spelling checker on the Wikipedia software because the one on my Google toolbar doesn"t seem to work on Wiki editing for some reason.   "

0	: It said it was the Royal Arms of the Queen in Scotland, not the Queen of Scotland. Perhaps Czar should actually read what he or she is reverting. The Arms are there due to a previous edit war, and that was the agreed compromise to add the current Royal Arms to the politics section. Either that or the correct Royal Arms will be added to the infobox.

0	  This is actually a popular myth. Raphael Holinshed, in his "Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland", 1577, p746, lines 48 thru 55, states that Richard III stood before Parliament immediately after the Buckingham rebellion in October 1483, and demanded "his innocencie concerning the murther of his nephews toward the world" (sic).
0	Hello Danny.  There seem to be a lot of strong emotions regarding the Crystal Gail Mangum page.  Admitably, there was no reliable, reputable source which was printing her name.  However, the defense lawyers have released her name now.  It is reliable, it is reputable, and it meets all of the requirements of Wikipedia.  It is unfair, and significantly biased to keep Crystal Gail Mangum locked while the David Forker Evans page is not.
0	:::The point of the long quote of Cahill, from his book, was to show that it's clear what he said, and it was in context.     And also, to make the point to Jeffro77 that Cahill alone originally was my source for the edit, not really Wilson.  The Wilson quote and ref came later on...only because of Jeppiz's demanding another source on this Talk page etc, etc.    That was really all.    My long comment above was mainly (though not exclusively) to Jeffro77, because of certain things he commented and wrote above.

Thanks, ~     Wikipedia:Surveillance awareness day You were supportive of the idea that Jehochman proposed: "A message is most effective when it matches the format of the media. We're an encyclopedia. On Feb 11, I suggest we fill our front page with articles, blurbs and news about mass spying and privacy. That will send a strong message, and help educate people. It's sort of like what we do on April 1, except serious instead of foolish."  Since this proposal received so much support, I and several others have done our best to begin the process of implementation.   That said, the proposal is very controversial with Main Page insiders who have, understandably, objections that boil down to WP:NOTADVOCATE.  It's valuable to have feedback from people who oppose any deviation from the status quo, but we really need feedback from people who understood Jehochman idea, supported it, and could tell us whether we're succeeding in "implementing the vision" that Jehochman laid out and how to improve the proposal.      If you have the time, would you lend your view over at Wikipedia:Surveillance awareness day.  If you want to see a list of custom content that could be available, we have a Arbitrary mockup #2, that shows lots of proposed content on one page.   Your feedback is most appreciated.     :Awesome to see the proposal come this far! I've been a bit busy this weekend, but I'll try to provide input where I can.

0	:::Randall, the problem with the cited articles is that they don't actually name any groups or individuals, or provide any actual examples of the said myths. Now I assume that the leg wounds article is mostly addressing the SCA, who are known for fighting from their knees and not targeting the lower legs, but how is the ordinary reader supposed to know that? All they get from the link is vague intimations that somebody, somewhere thinks fighting from the knees is realistic. The other cited article is even less specific. :::Ideally, to cite a myth/misconception you should link to an actual case of someone stating that myth - e.g. an article stating that swords weighed 30 lbs - and then to a rebuttal article, or to an article that gives the source of the misconception as well as a rebuttal. Otherwise the reader has no way of knowing that the articles are actually addressing a real argument, rather than knocking down straw men.

0	In the first stage of the British plan, both divisions were to occupy the higher ground either side of Willow Stream and Mametz on the right, then take Fricourt in the next stage, then move through the first German intermediate position and to the second intermediate position across the valley fronting Mametz Wood, with the right in contact with the XIII Corps at White Trench and the left linked with III Corps at Quadrangle Trench below Contalmaison. The objective was chosen as a place from which it would be possible to receive a counter-attack, with good artillery observation and to have dead ground, from which the artillery could begin a bombardment of the German second position. If the German defence collapsed, the 17th Division in corps reserve would pass beyond and advance through Mametz Wood, up the north side of Caterpillar Valley, to Bazentin le Grand, Longueval and Ginchy. Fricourt was not to be attacked frontally but isolated, for which the right hand brigade of the 7th Division was to take Mameta and then White Trench, the centre brigade was to form a defensive flank facing Fricourt and the wood, on the south rise of Willow Valley and the inner brigades of the 7th Division and 21st Division, were to wait in the front-line trenches opposite the village, until ordered forward by the corps commander.

0	  {{Mergeto|Watercraft|date=November 2009}}  Can watercraft be merged with boat in order to simplify the articles (boat, boating, ship, watercraft) and provide a more clear article (with 1 meaning for each) ? Would allow to add more specific and better information for each rather than give a general view/modification of text for each individual article.  Also, boating can then be described as the activity of moving a watercraft over water (something which is hard if it were only to describe boats)  Definition should also be changed to A watercraft or boat is ...     :"Watercraft" is a broader category of conveyances which enable passage across water, compared to "boat."  Watercraft includes personal watercraft, which is the generic name for jet-skis and waverunners, as well as canoes and other gizmos such as this.

0	: Could you explain what explanation you think is missing from this article?  There are extensive wikilinks to articles on the details of the science, as you know.     @Tony: Links are generally bad when it is possible to give an explanation in the body of the article.  Any science article should give a clear and coherent and succinct explanation of why scientists believe x.   In this case (correct me if I'm wrong), the reasons why scientists believe the global warming hypothesis (namely the hypothesis that the earth is continuing to warm, and that the increase in temperature in the last 100 years is not merely a random accident) are  * Empirical evidence: The temperature record, which suggests that the increase is not merely a random accident.   * Theoretical model: Radiative forcing by anthropogenically introduced factors (CO2, mainly) * Theoretical model: Feedback  As to what is missing. There is no explanation in the article about the statistics of temperature records, nor about the need (very important in science) to distinguish random fluctuations from changes caused by an underlying process. For example, current economic theory, the Efficient Market Hypothesis holds that there are no such things as trends in stock markets - the 'trends' you see are just the result of humans trying to see patterns in events that are essentially random.  A lot of that theory involves careful definition of randomness, and types of randomness.  I don't see an equivalent section in this article.   The explanation in the article of radiative forcing is somewhat better, but goes into unnecessary detail - the section on Greenhouse gases can't decide whether it is about the increase in CO2, or the effect of that increase.  The stuff on aerosols and soot tends to confuse the whole thing - that should be left to a sub-article.   The role of feedback is hardly explained at all.  That (I believe) is an important part of the hypothesis, yet the section discussing it is a strange list of things with no obvious purpose.   There is no heading section that ties the three parts of the hypothesis together.  The section 'climate models' is all rather uncertain.  It needs a summary at the beginning to explain what scientists conclude from their use of models, and perhaps some material on the uncertainty that is attached to models.

(Aurangzeb ! I stand in shadow of the Almighty and your men who are like goats,sheep and deer could not harm me inspite of your deceptions.) 18)If I had deceived by taking oath on Holy Quran like the way you have done, I would not have bought my dear fighters to this position of disadvantage (by bringing them out of Anandgarh fort).

Further, a google turns up no evidence Joseph Zemskova as a manager or anything else. Maybe I missed something but I spotted no undisputed indicators that 1980 is her birth year. On the whole, the preponderance of evidence (in the deleted talk page references) appears to be 1977.

0	   Korean articles  Hi, I noticed you were taking part in the discussion on the Talk:Hwang Seong-gyeong page. I think Bethereds behaviour is ridiculous and something needs to be done to stop his ownership of these pages. He said that he would "change the pages back until the end of time" as he thinks he is right in removing any Japanese reference from "his" Korean pages. There are many reasons why Japanese katakana should be included in these pages (the obvious being that the characters are created by a Japanese company and that every other article includes it bar the few Korean characters). Is there any way to call a moderator or administrator to this debate to stop Bethereds reverts? He seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes Korea is better than Japan (I've read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote Korea over Japan). Does he not realise that in these games, even Chang and Kim (from KOF) speak in the Japanese language and have never even uttered a Korean word? We need a vote or something to put him right. Thanks.

0	   SC Info   Im almost positive that this is not the place I'm supposed to be responding, but there is no reply link at your message.  Part of the reason for my "offense" is that I think your being unfair in referring to it as spam.  If I was just posting "Hey! Come visit my site," without any contribution, that would be one thing. But, when I posted anything from my own site, I had news attached to it.  You didn't have a problem when I posted the news of the departure of the producers and writers of the movie and linked to RopesOfSilicon.com, and you also didn't have a problem when I posted the purchase of Dreamworks by Paramount and linked to Yahoo! News, but when the news happened to come from my site, even if it is legitimate news, it's spam. I happen to be in a position that I have connections and can make alot more news than other sites. But that shouldn't make the news any less relivant in getting it to people.   When I take the time and care enough to try to make sure the info is correct, only to have it removed and replaced by the same wrong information, it's very frustrating, and it does come back to us at Ubisoft. For example, someone came to the official forums and said they saw on Wikipedia that Tom Cruise had accept the role of Sam Fisher in the movie. Well that is not true. So I had to correct him and that has happened a few times with a few wrong pieces of information. Which is why I went to the extent to find the correct info. But, if you are not in control of the other pages...and judging by the fact that the incorrect info that I removed has been replaced, it seems those who are in charge seem to perfer having incorrect information posted, so my hands are tied.   Frankly, I'm getting tired of trying to help and getting railed back for what I see as petty reasons everytime.   Also the back and forth with you removing my fan page from the list and the two other sites to the bottom, only to have me move them back was something I did because I have problems with an owner of another fansite following me around and well..not being nice. I was thinking it was him that was removing the info.

Then, by the end of the war, we were pretty much able to prove that [the attack] was the only logical explanation - other than his aircraft disintegrating."  ::Iraqi Air Force's archives?

I agree that, per the BLP page, this could fall under its purview to a small extent. My concern would be that someone in the future starts making sweeping changes (read: deletions) based on IDONTLIKEIT with the BLP as their smokescreen justification. I don't think that's your intent, but at some point it could happen from another. I'm hoping we all can mitigate that possibility now. Thanks in advance for clarifying.  •

0	   Wester Civ    Hello,   I had gotten an e-mail from one of Western Civ's fans asking why they don't have a wikipedia page. I remembered that there had been one at one point in time so I traced it back to you. I am not an active wiki user, so I do hope you forgive my lack of knowledge on how this works. I have read the reason for deletion and I have also read all of the criteria that must be met by a band to be considered notable. If I read the deletion log correctly I see that the reason for deletion was listed as "expired prod - borderline db-band" That said, I am including (as references) in this message links to their three published albums, a list of press garnered and links to some of their fan pages online. If you google the words "Western Civ" the band is the second and third return on google. I do believe that these elements are all examples of "Notability" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(music) as Wikipedia defines it for music. Since the page "Western Civ" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Civ is simply being used to redirect people to the "Western Culture" article at the moment, I do hope you will reestablish this page to it's original form, as a wiki for the band "Western Civ"  References: Link to Western Civ's published works: www.cdbaby.com/all/westernciv  Link to Western Civ's media press kit which includes 10 (of over 100) published reviews and articles about "Western Civ" as well as a partial list of FM stations that are playing Western Civ's music: www.sonicbids.com/westernciv  Links to Western Civ's websites:  www.myspace.com/westernciv www.twitter.com/westernciv www.westerncivrock.com  Please let me know where to go from here. I'll be looking forward to speaking with you further.  Thank You,    manager, Western Civ

0	OK... the towers part, I have no idea ). The map in the original Serbian article should help you out though. But I think I know what is confusing you. There are 3 parts of the fort. The foward, back, and the upper city. The forward city is comprised of TWO parts, the upper and the lower. This "upper" part of the forward city is NOT the upper city. Here:  *Forward city (the lowest, X axis) **Upper part (higher, Z axis) **Lower part (lower, Z axis) *Back city (higher than forward, X axis) *Upper city (higher, completely at the back, X axis)  That's how I'm reading it, and I'm pretty sure I'm right. And if you look at the map, tower 1 is in the upper city, and it's what the word 'citadel' is referring to. Now the moat... in the Serbian article, the present tense is used ("jer je povezan sa Dunavom"), so the moat is still connected, BUT the Danube is not filling it with water now ("koji ga je verovatno punio", trns. "which probably filled it with water").  
0	There is definately a major difference between caucasian and white.  Users slrubenstein and alun are definately taking a racist stance toward this article, and both sides can throw up rules and regs set by wikipedia to hide behind and attempt to justify your points of view (cited sources or not, it's obvious your point of view determines which sources you cite, and or choose not to), but this article as it exists is just wrong.  I believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article, and adding a new sub-section in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what 99.9% of the people on this earth consider a 'white person' to be, this 99.9% obviously not including alun & slrubenstein.  When it comes down to it, the term 'white person' can't really be defined, it's technically not a race, and any references sited are going to be garbage, as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another.  All that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with, or delete it entirely, but as it currently exists, I say again it's a joke.  You can cite all the references you want, and state all the wikipedia rules you want, you just can't understand that what you believe just isn't what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does, and as I said before, there's no way of either side proving the case for either side here, as 'white people' don't scientifically exist.  So, since you guys are obviously the type that will fight to the bitter end for some worthless cause, even though you have to know that most everyone disagrees with your understanding of what a 'white person' is, just do us all a favor and either delete this article (since there is no factual ground for either side to stand on), or just accept that the overwhelming majority of people see this differently from you, get over it, and let the majority rule on this article about a group of people that doesn't scientifically exist. /end commafest 2009

0	Danny, I have reverted your unjustified changes, as there are millions of people out there who have not given an opinion, and you cannot just throw what appears to be a tantrum because you are embittered by an argument with someone else. You alone do not possess the world's views. If someone got two people to agree with them that the entire JW page was to be banned and removed, would you allow this? Obviously not. The opinions of you, and one other, hardly justify or counteract the possible millions of views of others. Sorry, but you need to address your problems with the other poster, before you go removing text, as it looks like you are just being vindictive, which is not a tangible reason to edit anything.

0	  Speedy deletion of Sparky jones  A tag has been placed on Sparky jones, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G1 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the page appears to have no meaningful content or history, and the text is unsalvageably incoherent. If the page you created was a test, please use the sandbox for any other experiments you would like to do. Feel free to leave a message on my talk page if you have any questions about this.   If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or "db" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

0	:::Did you even read what I said he's trying to bully me. I tell what he actually did. He left a comment on my article, something which he doesn't even have any knowledge about and I don't think he's even taken a look at the article. This way he tries to annoy me. The same way he did on Castlevania. He knows I get angered quickly and he's taking advantage of that. He talked in such a way which won't seem offensive at all to you but would be clearly offensive to me. And as I earlier said I personally attacked him because he was threatning to block me for a simple mistake without even informing me. Doesn't that clearly tell he's a bully.

0	 ::It was originally both located (what we might call an "institutional home") and indeed published at Harvard University (or at least in Cambridge). "Home" and publishing location are not always the same.  For example, Mind's home is the University of York, but it's published at Oxford.  I do not believe the editor has to be located at the home, especially not anymore with email and cloud storage and all that fancy stuff.  I think the reason it helps to mention that it was originally at Harvard is because both the old issues list the location as Harvard and citations may list Harvard, so keeping a record of that here helps anyone trying to understand that the old issues are indeed part of this journal. Also, it could be recorded just for the record—it is part of the history of the journal after all. ,

0	:Yes. Whilst it is illegal to *be* drunk whilst editing wikipedia, nobody can ever actually be banned for editing it whilst drunk, because it is also illegal to ASK anyone if they are drunk. And if anyone is asked, they don't have to answer. This may seem bizarre, but it is also the same rules that apply in the House of Commons, and also may fondly remind us of the Laws of Thermodynamics, where it is impossible to break even until you reach absolute zero, but of the law says you cannot ever reach absolute zero in a finite number of steps.
0	   Numbers killled   The existing text matches is similar to that used for 9/11 which is "2,973 victims and the 19 hijackers died as a result of the attacks".

0	  -  I'm currently interested in just the principles involved in the radio signal scenario... and what conclusions inductive reasoning leads to.  I don't think it would be proper inductive reasoning to see a PNRS is caused by some intelligence, another PNRS is caused by intelligence, and to induce that the third PNRS is probably caused by some intelligence. There are unknown possible ways to generate a PNRS, and they cannot be ruled out simply because experience shows a couple other examples. This feels like the political approach to space shuttle launches about 10 years ago. Back in the day, designers speced the space shuttle to be safe for launch within a certain range of temperatures. Florida has uncooperative weather and often goes outside the safe range. Politicians wanted the shuttle to launch because it's good for elections. So, they pressure the upper management of NASA to launch outside the designed safe range. This happened a number of time without problem. At some point, management decided that the designers were wrong, and that a couple of launches outside their declared safe range meant that the real safe range was much wider. This continued for a few more launches until a space shuttle exploded on launch because it was too cold. If you shuffle a deck and pull 3 or 4 face cards in a row from the top of the deck, you can't really make any sort of probability measure as to what the next card will be. it could be a deck of only face cards. It could be many full decks. it could be a stacked deck. probabilities can't be determined off of a few rolls of the dice. two cases showing the PNRS was from an alien planet is not enough to make any sort of real probability estimate on the third PNRS. This is playing on a "gut feeling" that people have when they're playing roulette. casino's will post the last 20 rolls. Some gamblers will see these numbers and look for some sort of "pattern" and bet based off of that, on the "gut feeling" that the roullette wheel has some bias. They may even win a few times. But the casino is better off if the wheel is truly random, so any "patterns" is purely coincidental.  
0	   "must" vs "can"   The article states: "..we have become contaminated or debased by the influences of MEST, which must be transcended, if we want to save the planet." What drivel!  It is uncited.  What drivel!  Yet when I make a statement that is at least reasonable: "we have become contaminated or debased by the influences of MEST, which can be transcended" it is reverted by at least 2 editors.  The first sentence is uncited and silly.

It looks like a case of disruption due to dumbness rather than trying.  In particular, I'd call your attention to the incredibly asinine conversation I've had with him regarding Israel Idonije (though the side of in on my page has been reverted as vandalism by a third party) - I feel stupider just having talked to him. It looks to me like most, if not all, of his recent NFL edits should be reversed, but you're the expert!

0	: I just tagged the ones you marked.  However, before we take this to a more public review, I would like to hear why you think those images should be allowed to stay.  No point in wasting other editors time, if the images have absolutely no chance of being allowed to stay in the end.  Every image above said that it was taken from somewhere, and that's generally not allowed.  There are some specific exceptions, but I don't see them applying.  You should read the Copyright FAQ, specifically section 1.1 and 4.  If you took something from somewhere and modified it, it would count as a derivative work.  The copyright for the original still applies in that case, so it will not be allowed to remain here.  : As for using pictures created by your father, I think most people will accept if you claimed to have his permission (I think there is a more formal way to register the permission, but I wouldn't bother).  You should know, though, that the license tag you selected (public domain) allows anyone in the world to do anything they want with it.  Essentially, you're releasing the copyright.  That's good for Wikipedia, but if you think the picture is of great quality, you may wish to retain the copyright and instead license it with one of the GFDL licenses, which are still accepted on Wikipedia.  If this is something you want to do, I'll be happy to guide you through selecting an appropriate license for your needs.  : In short, it seems you are not entirely familiar with how copyrights work.  Even with a link back to the source, you can't just take the image and use it here.  There are some exceptions that can allow the use of non-free materials, such as fair use (section 5 in the FAQ), but then it would require re-tagging and a detailed fair use rationale.  It doesn't look like any of the remaining images can't conceivably be replaced by free alternatives, and none of them are absolutely essential to the articles they're used in.  Hence, you'll have a hard time getting the fair use rationale accepted.

The rifle shall achieve the dispersion set forth below when fired from a machine rest.

0	, 24 August 2007 (UTC)  There is no WP:RS to affirm the veracity of DI's doubtful claim either.  That is, you have no WP:RS either way.  Therefore it is not a verifiable fact that Picard (or any of the other 103 original signers) consented to or agreed with the DI's published interpretation or political position vis-a-vis PBS or any other subsequent political purpose regarding what should or shouldn't be taught in school.  All you have on verifiable record is that the 103 original signers called for skeptical examination of the evidence for scientific theories.  DI's unverifiable claim which fraudulently spins that into consensual agreement or support for their interpretation or political agenda is not a fact under the rules of Wikipedia.    All the rest of DI's propaganda is utter hogwash fraudulently perpetrated by the DI without the verifiably demonstrated consent of the original 103 individuals.

0	The inhabitants of Istanbul call the city Istanbul, armenians of Istanbul call that city KOstandnupolis or simply K.Polis, Russians call that city Stambul, some muslim nations call it Astambul but we all now that the name of the city is Kostantinopolis as it was found by Constantine and for 1000 years it was the capital of Byzantine EMpire by the name Kostantinopolis. Leningrad was Petrograd, Peter, Peterburg, Saint Petersburg but initially and finally it was and is Sankt Peterburg.SO my dear Dobbs, may be you read Kartuli and now that Georgians call their capital Tbilisi it is Tbilisi de fact and problably will always be. But 200 years ago that city was not called Tbilisi. And even 80 years ago,the majority of the inhabitants of the city, who were not Georgian but in fact Armenian, kept calling the city Tiflis. That city was very well known in the Russian Empire as the biggest industrial political and transportation center of Transcaucasia under the name Tiflis, the residence of Vice Royal of Caucasus. You can open any map of Russian Empire and you will never see any single mention of the name Tbilisi in any map published in that period. So nobody is arguing that at the moment the city is called Tbilisi but you also should not have any guts to call the nationalistic past of Tbilisi mistifying. The generation  who used to live in the city named Tiflis is still alive.

0	, 8 July 2006 (UTC)  Hank Williams didn't listen to too many of their records. He was a country boy and was influenced by swing music, yet he recorded pure rockers. Country music played as much a vital roll in the formation of rock n roll than black music, no matter how some people wish to deny it. Bill Haley, The Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly and many more of the greatest rockers had their roots in country. Chuck Berry was also influenced by it and , if he had been white, would have probably been seen as Country, rather than R&B.; Elvis is allowed to be called "The King", just as much as, say James Brown is allowed to be called "The hardest working man in showbiz", you don't see people who dislike him throwing everything but the kitchen sink in to try and make out it was a "marketing" ploy and their favorite artists worked harder.  02:29

Neither of these statements state that the game happened - in one the allegation is "dismissed as fantasy" by a judge, and in the other it is put in the mouth of the person who said it.

0	 :: What are you talking about? What you did is the fill-in-the-blank question: :::Gusuku ... often refers to castles or fortresses in ______ that feature stone walls. :: And your answer is "the Ryukyu Islands." That's wrong in the sense that we wouldn't say, "We speak Germanic" when we actually speak English. Castles or fortresses that feature stone walls are typical of Okinawa. Applying the term to other island groups is highly problematic to say the least. :: Narratives about gusuku are truly chaotic. No wonder you don't understand the situation correctly. No one can define the meaning of gusuku, which reminds me of family resemblance. What's why I avoided the "A is B" definition and used "A often refers to B" in the article. Explaining many conflicting theories as I did in the article is confusing. So I present just one hypothesis which I personally support: ::# The word gusuku originally meant stone walls that, say, partitioned agricultural fields. In other words, the word gusuku was not associated with castles. This meaning survives in Yaeyama. ::# There has been a long tradition of mountain cult. At first, the word gusuku was not associated with mountain cult. ::# In Amami, medieval mountain fortifications, that are typical of mainland Japan, were constructed, probably in response to Ryūkyū's repeated invasions. At this stage, the word gusuku was not associated with these mountain fortifications. ::# In Okinawa, some sacred mountains were later fortified with stone walls. One consequence of the fusion of mountain cult and fortification was the association of the word gusuku with mountain cult and/or fortification. The association of gusuku with stonework was weakened, but anyway Okinawa's castles and fortresses had stone walls. ::# Ryūkyū finally conquered Amami and introduced the noro ritual system to Amami. The new meanings of gusuku (1. related to mountain cult, 2. fortification) were also introduced to Amami. Most of the former medieval mountain fortifications were abandoned, but some were transformed into sacred places and given the name of gusuku even though they lacked stone walls. Some people of Amami might have interpreted the word gusuku as fortifications regardless of whether they had stone walls. Others reinterpreted the word as a sacred place regardless of whether it had stone walls. For this reason, some gusuku are on sand dunes, on cliff edges, and in caves. ::# Archaeologists of Okinawa Prefecture re-used the word gusuku as a technical term (yet another meaning). This was the source of confusion. They referred to Okinawa's castles and fortresses that feature stone walls as gusuku. They met fierce oppositions from folklorists because their use of gusuku was not grounded in people's actual usages. ::# Some archaeologists of Okinawa Prefecture attempted to extend the gusuku-as-fortifications framework to Amami, Miyako and Yaeyama, regardless of whether local people referred to the target as gusuku (The remains of human settlements of Yaeyama are not called gusuku by local people either). They met fierce oppositions not only from folklorists but also from fellow archaeologists. :: It is convenient to consider a dichotomy between inductive and deductive reasoning. Linguists, folklorists and ethnologists base their arguments on people's actual usages and try to infer a generalized conclusion from them. By contrast, archaeologists often define a term, independently of people's actual usages, and apply it to those which meet the definition. Due to lack of written materials, archaeologists need to name archaeological findings by themselves. So they naturally clash with scholars from other disciplines. :: It is important to note that the gusuku-as-fortifications framework (that's what the lead sentence says) is no longer supported in the archaeology of the Amami Islands. The renaming of so-called "Uragami Gusuku" was a symbolic event. A gusuku is a gusuku only because people refer to it as such. It's not because the referent meets some definition. In Amami, gusuku (as a technical term) is dead, long live gusuku (as to people's actual usages)!

Any breath, and I'd see it.  Originally, it seems that it needed to go to a "higher standard" because of sections.  Sheesh, man, but that's an insulting message for an article under heavy research and revision like that!  Anyway, "Please break it into subsections" would have gotten the sections done, had it been on the talk page.  Instead, though....  It's a sub-optimal method, at best.  No one should tag without extremely clear wording, and they shouldn't do that until the talk page has failed.

0	: Threatening Behavior?     This is an interesting question for the Wikipedia community: Does posting a link on a member’s Talk page to a YouTube video of yourself firing a weapon constitute threatening behavior?  Background: In the article about San Francisco Supervisor Chris Daly, I have been debating BillyTFried about whether the article should include information about Daly’s support of a 2006 gun control ballot initiative, Proposition H. I said it shouldn’t because Daly was only one of four sponsors of the initiative, and the initiative wasn’t especially controversial in SF (it won with 58% of the vote). However, because the initiative was controversial in the eyes of many pro-gun groups, it made national headlines with Daly’s name featured in newspaper articles, etc., BillyTFried thought Proposition H should be included in the Chris Daly article.  YouTube video: Yesterday night, BillyTFried posted  along with a link to a YouTube video of himself firing what looks like a semi-automatic weapon. (In case the video gets taken down, it is 1:43 minutes long and shows BillyTFried firing weapons at a shooting range while thrash music plays. BillyTFried occasionally leers at the camera. The video is titled “Shoot Em' Up!”.)  Last night when I read his post, I thought it was just plain weird and creepy, but I didn’t feel threatened. This morning, however, I mentioned it to my wife, who was horrified.

0	Interesting how people do things isn't it.  Give them a decent list of references and they go nuts.   I was a philosophy grad, so I am used to backing up just about every phrase if I have to, and researching far and wide.  I know Wiki is not supposed to be used as a source in many academic institutions, but people may tend to use it if it's constructed reliably, which can only be a good thing.  Thanks for your help, and I shall continue to try and reference where appropriate, and learn more about WIKI's processes.  Cheers YB
0	Dori, I appreciate your relatively objective assessment too. Of course, Sarek's statement above is inaccurate, the quoted statements were never made nor represent facts. Company apologists want to say things in the article without supporting it with sources.  Then they want to delete well-sourced statements they don't want the article to include. Several people said they questioned the notability, and fwiw, one of the founder pages, Sage_Weil, was deleted. The sourcing of the article is significantly improved since I got involved, as looking at the edit history shows. Pro-company COI editing has long been a problem there.     (outdent) Was it appropriate in your opinion, for Sarek to relocate comments at the AfD? Although he moved some of his (incidentally some of the first personally critical comments), he also left some of Scjessey's similarly critical comments in place, as well as making it impossible to follow.

0	   WikiProject Oregon   About this editI'm sorry you thought being moved to "inactive" status meant that you had to leave the project. Nothing could be further from the truth. In order to make the membership list easy to maintain, we happen to have created some artificial criteria for the active list and although you certainly contribute a lot to Wikipedia in general, at the time, I couldn't find any participation in Oregon-related articles. In the interests of ease of maintenance of the list (most people show no interest in such a thankless task and have no opinion about how it is managed), I never bothered to inform folks when they had been moved, but that was probably a mistake. Needless to say, you are a very active Oregon Wikipedian, especially in the area of the WikiWednesday group and the legislative stuff, and that certainly counts for a lot. I've taken the liberty of moving your name back into the active participants list, but feel free to change that if you're not comfortable. We've started a long-overdue discussion about the participants list on the WP:ORE talk page, and I'd really welcome your input.   It's unfortunate that we were being sort of cliqueish last time you participated there. Note that my efforts at clarifying who was who in that conversation got totally screwed up. In the first instance, I was trying to tell you that you were a part of the group toomy "quote marks" had nothing to do with a critique of how you addressed our gender. But when I did wish to clarify that AM was male and I was femaleand that was merely for your edification so you could avoid awkward grammarit came across as short and snappish, as I had otherwise said all there was to say about my opinion in the matter. And then I got busy and never clarified my comments further. I'm really sorry if you felt ganged-up on and I hope you will come back. Cheers! P.S. I hope to make it up to WikiWednesday again one of these days soonso many projects, so few vacations days...

The article is very much a mishmash that has resulted from "one agenda" editors stuffing something in without considering how it effects everything else, or how obscurely you you have to read something for it to be true.  This article should be simplified, with some history, some definition (the explanation that gaming refers to the business of offering gambling games for instance is very important) and some short paragraphs that lead to main topic articles.  It seems we do have a sense here that such a generalized/simplified/less contentiously worded article that refers to other articles where we deal with something in more depth is called for.  I'd rather  or someone else would take a stab at it, but otherwise I could take a stab at this idea on the next week or so  UNLESS someone now wants to say "we gotta have that beatable games section", because a rewrite will be probably just a waste of time if more than one person wants to fanatically keep that section as it is.

0	   My position on the two Irelands, using Arbcom and admin abuse   I give my views on the two Irelands in the paragraphs below, but I will begin with what I feel is most serious.  I've had a look back, and IMO, there is one thing in particular I that is pressing for Wikipedia's future here:  The admin  must have his adminship fully questioned in the correct place. No one has a chance on Wikipedia when an admin acts (and wheel wars) like he has done – and I believe he has overstepped the line, and made a difficult but legal situation into a nightmare situation for everyone. I warned him of the mayhem that would be caused if Ireland was simply reverted into being a cultural all-island article, but he ignored me. This edit note (and selective deletion) is an example of the kind of intellectual demeaning by admin that lead to me losing my own temper. You cannot treat adults like children. It shows feelings of superiority in being an admin - which must not be condoned. Aside from his attitude, the way he reversed admin Tariqabjotu's Ireland Move, citing a very small hand-picked selection of admin who share his personal position on this - to his own personal wishes, was totally unacceptable. Where were all the other admin I saw who spoke up? For reasons I give after after I get the following paragraph off my chest, he completely shattered Wikipedia for me when he did that, and his reasoning for doing it showed it to be nothing other than an act of hypocrisy, as well as self interest. Arbitration are not there to be interested themselves (by their own admission) - they are only there to be there, and there is nowhere else now to to go. It has all been completely messed up now – so Arbcom has to be pulled in.  I regret that I am leaving Wikipedia with the worse kind of people in my mind, in a place that is actually full of fantastic unacknowledged philanthropy. I won't go the way of saying what I (100%, in all good faith, IMHO, genuinely, without doubt etc, etc) honestly think this is comparable to - people call it a 'Godwin', a commonly-used term which belittles the technical purity of the very example - an early internet 'battle' won by some clever person, for sure. But you have to think beyond the cliche. The talk-page admin 'cop out' over any car crash, is normally to pretend this place is just a pastime, but WIkipedia is a little more important than that - no? And conspiracy theorising - don't point that one at me – it us such an ugly slur. Who needs those, when you give ‘’individuals’’ so much power? People group - they always do. The only 'conspiracy' could be within wondering why Wikipedia has to be structured in this way. It's a Sunday drive, and includes the world - but anything difficult like this? The structure simply breaks down. So do some people want a loose ship? A negative answer would have little to do with the Irelands anyway.  Two wrongs don't make a right, and equally bad is a wrong made after a right. Now how was Deacon right? The first move to Ireland disam/(state)/(island) was rational and sound 'policy-over-polling', the reversal (in the horrendous way it was done) was wrong in every possible way. Those who were interested in doing so, simply needed to re-debate it from where it was (perhaps prove it in a global poll?). But why should I do even more work towards facilitating that? I have given hundreds of hours of my life to this already. And where now were those originally opposing? A number of them were addressing new content. The carefully avoided truth is that a global poll (so hard to bring about – I know, as I’ve tried) would simply bring in changes. I gave my time editing the changes I saw before me, and my work has been cynically thrown down the drain. And look at the edit frenzy now! Too few admin actually give a shit when people's time is wasted. The reversal of tariqabjotus's move has vindicated every troll, SPA, contentious editor, sock-maker and IP-abuser watching, who in this Ireland problem, are the worker-minions of the wholly-debilitating 'dual Irish country' "solution".  Ireland isn't Palestine, it isn't the People's Republic of China, it's just a country commonly called 'Ireland' on an island which has two states on it (one with a sea divide) - called Ireland - and Wikipedia, despite the efforts of so many, hasn't been allowed to properly address and present that undeniable fact. The Irish country now has two time-sharing homes again - two mixed-up modern-day country articles, one of them subsuming part of a separate country altogether - simply because it shares the island.

That on the Roman Empire article, the maximum extent of the Empire includes Trajan's temporary holdings in the East including Mesopotamia.

0	(UTC)  :MTBF has a lot of meaning, but it does not mean the device will last 136 years. All of these misunderstandings are really surprising. And it does not mean that you will not see a failure in home use. Saying you will never see a failure is just dumb.  What does it really mean? It means that one out of every 136 devices will have a mechanical failure every year. Or, equivalently, if there were 1360 devices spinning, then on average, 10 would mechanically fail every year. That is the meaning of 1.2 million hours. But, this needs to be put into context. Infant mortality is not counted, because those devices never were in use. Software failures, user failures, infrastructure failures (brownouts), heat and overheating, and viral or deliberate attacks are not counted either. So, a home user is still going to see the failure every few years. Even with enterprise drives. What the home user should not see is driving the drive to death. It should be built for continuous action of the head, and that action not fail for, on average, 1.2 million hours.   21:43, 9 February 2014
0	  2D versus 3D Reconnection  I'd just like to make a comment. This article does a fine job describing reconnection in 2D. The 3D generalization is not trivial though. In 3D sweet-parker or petcheck reconnection effectively becomes 3D null-point reconnection (without getting into quai-separatrix layers versus true separatricies). In addition, the application to the Magnetosphere is very different than the application to the solar corona, in that magnetospheric reconnection topologically requires a 4-flux system, whereas the solar corona requires only a 2-flux system.  Okay, I didn't realize how technical this article was going to be until I started writing it.  I'll make an effort to fill in some of the empty links, provide a diagram or three, and place links to this article on the relevant pages.  I'm currently conducting an experiment to study magnetic reconnection - if you have questions, post them here or on my talk page...  but be warned, I'll be at a conference for the next week, so my response may be slow.   I removed an anonymous edit that claimed magnetic reconnection occurs when the magnetic pressure exceeds the plasma pressure (ie when the plasma  parameter is less than unity).  This is not the case!  Magnetic reconnection (or the lack thereof) is related to the line-tying effect of high electrical conductivity, not to the magnetic pressure.    Zowie. While you are correct that reconnection occurs in both high and low beta plasmas, the process is local and does not depend on whether the system is line tied or not. Formally, magnetic reconnection is the tearing mode, of resistive MHD instability theory (see Furth, H.P., Killeen, J., and Rosenbluth, M. N., 1963, Phys. of Fluids, 6, 459). Several researches have shown line-tying the system simply slows the (linear) tearing mode growth rate (see Velli, M. and Hood, A. W., 1989, Sol Phys 119, 107; Velli, M., Einaudi, G., and Hood, A. W., 1990, ApJ, 350, 419).  —Preceding unsigned comment added by      Topology rather than current sheets  I took the liberty of reducing the discussion of current sheets, which are not directly related to reconnection (they are in some sense a symptom of lack of magnetic reconnection!) and instead introduced separatrix surfaces and separators, the topological terms describing the domain boundaries.  (Note that separatrices, and magnetic reconnection, can exist in a vacuum, while current sheets cannot).    The discussion still needs considerable work, some work on the X-point figure (it would be nice to have the seapratrices and separator marked), an perhaps a 3-D figure to visualize domain topology  but I'm out of borrowed time for today.    Happy new year!      While it is true that topological separatricies exist independent of the plasma, reconnection cannot occur in vacuum. Reconnection absolutely requires a plasma, because it's the plasma that supports the dissipative current sheets that form along these separatricies.  Dissent about "Magnetic Reconnection?" Should notable peer-reviewed papers dissenting with the theory of magnetic reconnection be included in the article?  If so, Nobel prize winning plasma physicist Hannes Alfvén (the so-called "Father of MHD") has dissented in several articles (Double Layers and Circuits in Astrophysics, On frozen-in field lines and field-line reconnection), calling "magnetic merging" ("reconnection") a pseudo-science. More recently, electrical engineer Don Scott has also published a dissenting paper (Real Properties of Electromagnetic Fields and Plasma in the Cosmos).     Of course not. That would be scientific heresy. This is about proping up failed theories and supporting misguided research.  To quote Alfvén: The conecepts 'frozen-in magnetic field lines' and 'field-line reconnection' play a certain role in discussions of the theory of the magnetosphere.  The use of these concepts has been criticized and we shall here demonstrate that both concepts are unnecessary and often misleading.

0	I think the problem here is everyone is assuming that borders were so fluid as to be unrecoverable, but this is not the case. Towns and districts were known and accepted as traditionally Mercian, or traditionally West Saxon, etc. - even if they were temporarily occupied by another kingdom. These accepted boundaries can be recovered very simply - by using ecclesiastical boundaries. Each kingdom had one or more bishoprics, and their boundaries are known (in many cases they survived unchanged until the Reformation, and any earlier or later changes are recorded).
0	 ::::::::What killed Timothy Treadwell was a combination of his willful disregard of safety practices around brown bears  a violation of wildlife ethics  and his mindless moral values.  Treadwell quit using an electric fence while camping and refused to carry bear spray.  The fence would have eliminated the need for Treadwell to confront bears close to his camp, but he didn't want to "hurt" his "friends".  The end result was two dead bears and two dead people.  How moral is that?  There's a reason why campers and the Park Rangers who camp in Katmai use electric fences.  They work!  Not only that, it's a matter of wildlife ethics to use a fence to protect not only yourself, but the bears, too.

0	 ::::Comment.  It's confusing enough that I am not sure what "disagree" means in this conversation.  A quick run through my sources indicates that "folk costume", "folk dress", "national dress", "ethnic costume", "traditonal dress" etc. are all used pretty much interchangeably.  I would support a move to "folk costume" or "folk dress" for the reasons cited above, but "folk costume" should not be a subset of "national dress" since modern political boundaries do not necessarily match either ethnic boundaries or political boundaries as they were at the time that folk dress was ossified (at least in Europe - as mentioned, some folk dress is still evolving).  ::::[For what it's worth, I wouldn't characterize square dance clothes or bolo ties as folk dress - western wear is a modern retro concept based on romanticized notions of 19th century clothing, and bolo ties are a modern invention!  But bolo ties and cowboy shirts are certainly regional dress.]  ::::By the way, the use of narrow use "costume" to mean "theatrical costume" is about as common as the use of "dress" to mean "a woman's garment with a skirt".  Both "costume" and "dress" have these narrow, non-specialist, everyday definitions which make it really difficult to decide what terms will be understood by users of Wikipedia.  "Clothing" is probably the most neutral and inclusive term, but we struggle in choosing "Medieval clothing" vs. "Medieval costume" vs. "Medieval dress".  And "folk clothing" is not used in the specialist literature and sounds really dumb.  In the museum and art-historical worlds, "costume" and "dress" are both preferred terms.  ::::OED definitions are pertinent here:  ::::*COSTUME: The mode or fashion of personal attire and dress (including the way of wearing the hair, style of clothing and personal adornment) belonging to a particular nation, class, or period. ::::*DRESS: Personal attire or apparel: orig. that proper to some special rank or order of person, or to some ceremony or function; but, in later use, often merely: Clothing, costume, garb, esp. that part which is external and serves for adornment as well as for covering.  :::: is right, in that there isn't a simple solution; we're going to have a ton of redirects and alterate terms whichever way we go.  Gievn the OED definitions, I'd say "Folk costume" is more accurate.  But I personally prefer "Folk dress", and I'd choose that over "National dress". -

These results are entirely consistent with earlier work on a nesting beach of endangered loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), wherein 87-99% of hatchlings from the rookery in each of 3 years were females because sand temperatures at nest level were high (39). If such strongly female-biased cohorts lead to highly skewed adult sex ratios, then the probability of population extinction may be greatly enhanced.   :*It has been referenced and the "speculation" was restored.    count email) 15:

0	   The Cramp Twins    The Cramp Twins is an animated series created by cartoonist Brian Wood. The show was produced in association with Cartoon Network Europe. It is about Lucien Cramp (Kath Soucie) and Wayne Cramp (Tom Kenny), not-so identical twins who live with their hygiene-obsessed mother (Nicole Oliver) and their Western-obsessed father (Ian James Corlett) in the fictional town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucian's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe (Lee Tockar), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Reverend Andrew Sparks) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss. Hillary Hissy (Demi Buchanan, who also plays Tony's mom Lily and Mrs. Winkle). Lucien's friends include environment-friendly Tony Parsons (Terry Klassen who also plays Tony's dad, Seth) and Mari and Luke Harrison (Adam Little).  Season one premiered in the UK in September 2001 on Cartoon Network (UK) and on February 2, 2002 on CBBC on BBC One respectively and has reached high popularity with children. Season one ended on 21 June 2002. A second season premiered in Autumn 2003. Season 2 finished in 2003. Season 3 started in 2004 and ended in 2005. Season 4 began in 2006 and ended that same year. The show is currently licensed to Cartoon Network.  The show was originally canceled in the US in February 2005, when Mew Mew Power (aka "Tokyo Mew Mew") was airing in its slot February 19, 2005, and it was originally intended to be a sneak peek for the series to air September 2005 with Cramp Twins continuing to air there, but 4Kids TV decided to cancel The Cramp Twins to put Mew Mew Power in its slot. A press release went out about a possible 3-part finale answering any unanswered questions, but the show returned in the summer of 2006, and later with more new episodes.   Main characters  * Lucien Cramp: Lucien is the smarter of the twins, but also considered the 'eco-loser'.  Gentle and sensitive, Lucien is frequently bullied and name-called by his brother; Wayne's favourite choice of addressing Lucien is "Girlpants", but he sometimes calls Lucien a "nerd". Lucien enjoys science, nature and is a vegetarian. Lucian longs for a pet, but due to his mother's extreme cleaniliness rules, he is denied owning any.  Secretly, Lucien keeps a worm farm under his bed, that only Tony, Mari, Wayne and Wendy know about. It is shown in many episodes that Lucien has a fear of clowns. He has many skills, including knitting, and has shown interest in playing the harp. Lucien likes going to Soap City's only swamp (the only place he gets peace from Wayne, who is afraid of the place) where Tony lives. Lucien is technically the older twin as he was born first in the opening credits. Lucien Cramp is voiced by Kath Soucie.  * Wayne Archibald Cramp is the blue-skinned antihero of the series. He is taller, destructive, and the less intelligent of the twins. Wayne is obsessed with junk, which he collects and hides in his room; he spends most of his time at the junkyard, owned by only friend, Dirty Joe. Unlike Lucien, who loves the swamp, Wayne is terrified of the place, and also has a fear of frogs. Wayne is constantly annoyed by Wendy Winkle who has a crush on him. Wayne's only love is anything sugary, his main source of energy, and if he is deprived from it, he becomes tired and speaks nonsense. Wayne likes to give the impression that he's the best-behaved of the twins to his mother, and sometimes Miss Hissy, but in truth, he likes to manipulate to achieve his goals.  Sometimes Lucien who gets in trouble for Wayne's behaviour, although in many episodes, somehow the tides turn and Wayne is punished by pure coincidence.

I'm a little bit flustered by this; I seem to see equal amount of criticism for both, each coming from the opposite side. I'm a bit confused why you say there is consensus for one and not the other. I would appreciate if you could explain. Thanks.

0	   You have no idea what you're talking about  Unlike the silly kids who come to this site and put this false information everywhere, I actually KNOW as a FACT that Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin are HARD ROCK and NOT, by ANY MEANS AT ALL Heavy Metal. Sabbath and Deep Purple themselves have stated clearly many times that they are NOT HEAVY METAL. You are putting false information on this site, which is why this place is so unreliable. I am cleaning it up and making it more accurate. I would guess you are clearly much younger than me, I was brought up with these bands and I know better. The same with the stupid idea that "heavy metal" started in the late 60's. It DID NOT. It started in the mid 70's, I know, because I saw it form. Being the "forefather" of heavy metal does NOT MAKE YOU HEAVY METAL YOURSELF. It is you who is vandalising this website by putting false information on these bands pages after they have made clear several million times that they are NOT what everyone keeps saying they are. It is also easy to hear the difference. If I had the power, it would be people like YOU who would be blocked because you are making this site an unreliable source of information. IF you think you're right, ask the bands themselves. Then maybe you will change how you think. But I doubt it. Take care.

I'm sorry you're in a content dispute with the other editor, and I can see you feel slighted by him.

I don't see any understanding on your part for why you have been blocked, nor do I see any evidence of "bias" on behalf of the blocking administrator, so unblocking would seem unwise at this point.

0	No, it is not the same as the Fischer clock. The Bronstein clock would already get closer, as in byo-yomi like in Bronstein but unlike Fischer one cannot 'save up' time for the next move. However, byo-yomi differs from both systems because the extra time is only received when the normal playing time has already been lost, whereas the Fischer and Bronstein systems do it from the first move on.
0	   Detailed chronology - 2   Now that the legalities are covered...  #This is massive material. It tends to overwhelm the article, which is now bloated to three times the recommended size of a Wikipedia article. I think we need to summarize here and factor out to separate articles, maybe one for each year. #While clearly well researched, the material is quite POV in the selection of what it covers. I'm firmly on the side of the Republic  one of the first things I ever learned to say in Spanish was "Sueño y una ametralladero y Franco se va paseo,  but this Wikipedia articles are not the place for partisan polemic. A chronology this detailed should also include the anti-Catholic atrocities by anarchists and other supporters of the Republic. This doesn't. #The material is written in indifferent English. Right now, I'm engaged in a copy edit, which is being made difficult by the size of this article and the current miserable state of the servers. #I do not think it is appropriate in Wikipedia to repeatedly refer to the Nationalists as "the Fascists".  Would I call them that in my own writing outside Wikipedia? Sure. And someone on the Right would probably use different words than "Republicans", "legitimate government", etc. in his/her own writing. Here, I'd favor "Nationalists" or "Insurgents" almost everywhere that the article currently says "Fascists". Does anyone want to present an argument to the contrary? Anyway, I'm trying to clean this all up. Suggestions are welcome. So is help. I'm not sure how much time I'll have for this  it's not my main focus within Wikipedia, and I suspect that (for entirely good reasons) I may soon have a lot less time for Wikipedia than I've lately had.   |  
0	  Two out of three isn't a very large majority.  The person who said in their "Edit Summary" that Irv Kupcinet was super-famous and known to every American is showing POV.  If his newspaper column was syndicated to 100 newspapers, as the person (Wildhartlivie) claimed, that's leaving out many cities and towns.  I checked all three of the newspapers that existed in Washington, DC at the time Karyn died, and none of them carried "Kup's column."  People in DC couldn't watch his TV talk show, either.  It wasn't listed in the local TV guide.  If a "celebrity" wasn't in Washington, DC in 1963, then he/she wasn't in a lot of places.  Same goes for Raleigh, North Carolina.  I checked the News & Observer in 1963.  No Kup's column.  Other good sources are people who were over the age of 18 living in DC and Raleigh in 1963.  I've talked with them, and they say they never heard of Irv Kupcinet until I told them about Karyn's death.  I already named the Raleigh newspaper.  If you insist DC people did indeed know about and care about Irv Kupcinet at the time his daughter died, then please name all three DC newspapers from that period.    If your majority is as sound as you claim, then let's hear from the contributor known as "Gamaliel."  If you know so much about Wikipedia, then maybe you know what Gamaliel's position is.  He/she has said that negative information about coroner Harold Kade is relevant as long as it is sourced.  And it is.

0	   fair use image reduction   Wiggy, I saw with a number of your edits that you removed  tags from fair use images. As an example, this is one of your edits. The problem here is the image as uploaded is 1,500 × 452 pixels. In its use in the one article it is in, it is 300 x 90 pixels. The maximum size we need is therefore 300 x 90 pixels in this case. Note that the tag I mentioned above says "A high-resolution non-free image is considered a copyright violation and may be deleted." This is therefore a blatant copyright violation, which is why the tag was placed on the image. I am undoing your edits in this vein as appropriate to re-add the tags to reduce the images. Please do not remove these tags without conducting the image size reductions as appropriate to the maximum size used in any articles they are used in. Thank you,

0	Ok , Thank You for your help and insight . This page Clearly states that the new wave of british heavy metal is one of the components thus the "heavy-ier" feel than punk . Someone put in metal I thought it was already there for a long time, it kept getting removed . after some careful thought (I was there) I studied music history from Johnny Dodds to "hardcore punk" , I looked it to it and it makes total sense. The complaint from one page is there was no source and it was tagged I think as as "fact claim" . I looked to see if there was a source there was , it got removed all of a sudden by 3 pages. No explanation . Except the kind of "cop" out, "Not reliable because its at about.com" , the writer is a college educated journalist since late 80s. Not "about.com" he just wrote something they "host" .  So a completely different page gets created and reverts it anytime I put it back, so I decided to further inspect the story and online history (section) at the page in the U.K section which is part of the creation (Next to a Picture of Lemmy) says "Referred to under a number of names including "U.K. Hardcore", "UK 82", "second wave punk",[66] "real punk",[67] and "No Future punk",[68] it took the previous punk sound and added the incessant, heavy drumbeats and distorted guitar sound of New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, especially Motörhead.[69]" So I felt the "heavy metal"  may have mislead and changed it to the more appropriate NWOBHM and this new page changes it its the only thing the page has ever done , created a few days ago, no explanation, no discussion on the talk page, removing sourced material and contradicting the article itself . Now that page has done 4 reverts. in one day....Can you go and see this please. I don't always sign in to my page and I realize I may have not reached the status to be able to handle this by not getting credit for all my work here .  Ill probably never ask you for help again buy you seem to be Very helpful . Thank You.

This is because Latvian SSR was just "playing" a country on the political stage, it was not a real country. "Latvian SSR" was part of the "Soviet Union" as a country founded by the Soviets. But this country didn't have any territory, or people, or any legitimate right to exist. The territory and people since 1918 uninterruptedly have belonged to the Republic of Latvia which has never been part of the Soviet Union.

Detailed in the lawsuits www.disneylawsuit.com  filed in Federal court “PUBLIC RECORD” (2005 & 2006), and in various national and international news and press releases, state that in the early 1990's independent film maker Royce Mathew had pitched his original supernatural pirate story to the Walt Disney Company which is about “cursed pirates” of the Black Pearl pirate ship; pirates who don't want anything to do with the plunder/return a treasure because they are cursed, with effects of the curse they endure is fully revealed by moonlight and the gold medallion on a gold chain with mystic properties able to summon/call.  Royce Mathew had made a short derivative video work in 1994.  Royce Mathew’s credits included projects for Paramount Pictures, Allan Carr, David DeCoteau and Charles Band and his Full Moon Entertainment company.  Then years later, as the lawsuit details, via Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, the Walt Disney Company, had incorporated various homages from their Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride attraction into Royce Mathew’s supernatural pirate story, and are selling it as Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl movie franchise.   The Walt Disney Company states that Royce Mathew’s claims and lawsuits have no merit.    During legal proceedings,  the Walt Disney Company, Jerry Bruckheimer (films/Inc.), Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio “The Defendants” were all represented by the same team of attorneys headed by Sanford “Sandy” Litvack, who is a close associate of the Walt Disney Company (Michael Eisner), who also was the Walt Disney Company’s attorney in the noted lawsuit of Jeffrey Katzenberg vs the Walt Disney Company. 2008 False article blocked test 0 220995414.0    No I will not   Consider this a warning to you.
